      "[Document(metadata={'source': 'https://peterattiamd.com/longevity-course/lesson1/'}, page_content='Lesson 1 What Exactly is “Longevity”? Longevity, as I define it, goes beyond the simple measure of how many years you get to live. It’s not just about adding time to your life; it’s about adding life to your time . When most people think of longevity, they envision some magical formula or elixir that promises to keep them alive forever, or at least well past 100 years. But, in reality, longevity is far more nuanced and involves optimizing both how long ( lifespan ) and how well ( healthspan ) you live. It’s about living longer while maintaining your health, fulfillment, and independence for as long as possible. This dual focus shifts our thinking from merely extending lifespan to extending and maximizing healthspan , ensuring that our extra years are not spent simply enduring, but truly living. My approach to longevity is firmly rooted in science but also involves a bit of art—the art of applying knowledge in a way that fits each individual’s unique context, current health status, goals, and more. Ultimately, longevity means outliving not just your life expectancy but outliving your functional expectations, functioning like someone much younger for as long as possible . Defining Lifespan Lifespan is a straightforward concept: it’s the total duration of your life , measured from the day you are born to the day you die. Our average lifespans have increased dramatically over the past century. We’ve moved from a world where infectious diseases and accidents were the primary threats to a place where most of us can expect to live into our seventies, eighties, or even longer. However, increasing lifespan without addressing the quality of those years can lead to what I call the “Tithonus error” —named after the unfortunate Greek mythological figure who was granted eternal life but not eternal youth. His body continued to decay, making his extended existence more of a curse than a blessing. In modern terms, lifespan alone doesn’t capture what most of us truly want, which is not just more years but more good years. Defining Healthspan Healthspan refers to the length of time in your life when you are healthy, free from chronic disease, disability, and significant mental or physical decline . This is what really matters, as healthspan measures quality of life, emphasizing functional years when you can move well, think clearly, and enjoy meaningful activities without being hampered by The Four Horsemen of Chronic Disease : heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative conditions, and metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes. To maximize healthspan , three critical components of health must be preserved: 1. Physical Function Maintaining physical function is about preserving your ability to move, lift, and carry out daily activities without pain or difficulty. This encompasses strength, endurance, flexibility, and stability. Ensuring that you retain these abilities as you age is crucial for maintaining independence and quality of life. 2. Cognitive Health Cognitive health is about keeping your brain sharp, your memory keen, and your ability to think clearly and make decisions intact. As we age, cognitive decline can become a major concern, so strategies to preserve and even enhance cognitive function are essential for a long, fulfilling life. 3. Emotional Health Emotional well-being is often overlooked, but it’s just as important as physical and cognitive health. Managing stress, maintaining strong relationships, and having a sense of purpose are all important factors in preserving emotional health. A well-rounded approach to healthspan ensures that you are not only living longer but also living happier. Compressing Morbidity: Minimizing the Gap Between Healthspan and Lifespan While lifespan and healthspan are related, they are fundamentally different concepts. The real goal is to minimize the gap between these two —ideally, to compress the period of decline so that you remain fully functional until the end of your life. This concept, referred to as “compressing morbidity,” means we don’t want to live long only to spend our last decades in poor health. Instead, we want to live long and live well, extending the period where we’re healthy, active, and independent. The challenge is that current approaches to medicine often focus solely on lifespan —keeping people alive as long as possible—without necessarily considering the quality of that extended time. We need to shift our focus to healthspan , which is a much better measure of a life well-lived. Ultimately, the goal is to align your healthspan as closely as possible with your lifespan . The Challenge Today’s medicine often focuses on extending lifespan without emphasizing healthspan , leading to years of poor quality of life. The Goal Minimize the gap between lifespan and healthspan , aiming for a compressed period of decline. This approach, known as “compressing morbidity,” ensures that the majority of your life is spent in good health, not prolonged illness. Medicine 3.0: A Primer on a Proactive Approach to Health Medicine 3.0 represents a paradigm shift in how we approach health. While Medicine 2.0 has done wonders for acute care —saving lives through surgeries, antibiotics, and emergency medicine—it often falls short when it comes to chronic diseases. These long-term conditions don’t arise overnight ; they develop slowly, often over decades, and are typically well entrenched by the time symptoms appear. The problem is that our healthcare system, as it currently stands, is designed to react to diseases once they have already taken hold, rather than preventing them in the first place. Medicine 3.0 takes a different approach. It’s proactive rather than reactive , focusing on early intervention, prevention, and understanding individual risk factors long before they manifest as disease. This new era of medicine is driven by better technology, better data, and a more nuanced understanding of chronic disease progression. It’s about leveraging everything from genetics and biomarkers to lifestyle optimization and personalized interventions tailored to your unique biology. The implications of Medicine 3.0 are vast. Imagine knowing your specific risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer, or Alzheimer’s based on your genetics, family history, and biomarkers, and then being able to take targeted actions to mitigate those risks decades before the first symptoms appear. Instead of waiting for disease, you take control of your health trajectory , actively working to prevent the conditions that have plagued previous generations. Medicine 3.0 is about empowerment . It’s about providing you with the knowledge and tools to actively manage your health, improve your longevity, and compress your morbidity, allowing you to live your longest and best life by shifting from passive and reactive to active and intentional. Core Principles: Proactive Care: Focus on preventing disease rather than treating it once it’s entrenched. Personalization: Leverage genetics, biomarkers, and lifestyle data to tailor interventions. Empowerment: Equip individuals with tools and knowledge to actively manage their health. Implications: Assess and mitigate disease risks (e.g., heart disease, cancer) long before symptoms arise. Use technology and data to guide personalized, preventive care strategies. Future Vision: Medicine 3.0 empowers you to take control of your health trajectory, transforming healthcare from passive treatment to active prevention. Conclusion The pursuit of longevity is not about some far-fetched quest to live forever. It’s about taking control of your health today to ensure that you can live as well and as long as possible . By embracing the principles of Medicine 3.0, we can align our lifespans more closely with our healthspans , maximizing the time we have to enjoy all that life has to offer. The tools, knowledge, and strategies are available to us now. The challenge—and the opportunity—is to use them to outlive not just our life expectancies but to outlive our functional expectations. Master this lesson: Explore more content on today’s topic'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://peterattiamd.com/longevity-course/lesson2/'}, page_content=\"Lesson 2 First principles: Goals, Risks, and Tactics In our pursuit of longevity, it’s crucial to understand that our journey isn’t just about living longer but about optimizing every aspect of our health so we can live those extra years fully. To do this, we must have a clear set of goals, assess the risks we face, and develop effective tactics to mitigate those risks. Here’s a breakdown of my approach to goals , risks , and tactics , which serves as the foundation for achieving not just a longer life but a better one. Goals The Marginal Decade ™ and the Centenarian Decathlon ™ Setting clear goals is essential, especially as we look ahead to the later decades of life. To frame these goals, I use two concepts: the Marginal Decade and the Centenarian Decathlon™ . These help us focus on what really matters as we age— maintaining the ability to live a full and functional life for as long as possible . The Marginal Decade ™ The Marginal Decade™ refers to the last ten years of life , which are often marked by significant decline. For many, this period is spent battling the consequences of chronic diseases, reduced physical and cognitive abilities, and diminished independence. The truth is, most people’s Marginal Decade™ is not a happy time. They are unable to engage in activities they once enjoyed, whether that’s playing with their grandchildren, traveling, or even performing basic daily tasks. The goal of my approach is to redefine this Marginal Decade™ by actively planning for it. I ask my patients to envision what they want their final years to look like. What do you want to be able to do in your seventies, eighties, and nineties? This exercise forces us to confront the realities of aging and set goals that are both meaningful and achievable. The Centenarian Decathlon ™ The Centenarian Decathlon ™ is not an actual athletic event but rather a conceptual framework for aging well . It involves identifying the ten most important physical tasks you want to be able to perform as you approach 100 years of age. These tasks can range from athletic endeavors like swimming or hiking to everyday activities like lifting a suitcase into an overhead compartment or picking up a child from the floor. The Centenarian Decathlon ™ helps you visualize exactly what kind of fitness you need to build and maintain as you age . It shifts the focus from aimless exercise to purposeful training, with each “event” representing a physical ability that will support your independence and quality of life in your later decades. For example, to maintain the ability to lift a 20-pound suitcase when you’re 80, you need to be training to lift 40 to 50 pounds today, as strength declines with age. Examples of Centenarian Decathlon ™ Events: Hike 1.5 miles on a hilly trail. Get up off the floor using minimal support. Carry two five-pound bags of groceries for five blocks. Lift a 20-pound suitcase into the overhead compartment on a plane. Climb four flights of stairs in three minutes. These tasks serve as benchmarks, guiding your training and helping you stay focused on maintaining the functional abilities that matter most as you age. The Centenarian Decathlon ™ is not limited to ten events; it’s tailored to your personal interests and lifestyle goals, ensuring that you remain active and capable well into your later years . Setting the Right Goals for Longevity Both the Marginal Decade™ and the Centenarian Decathlon ™ are tools to help us redefine our approach to aging. They encourage us to set goals that prioritize healthspan , focusing on maintaining physical and cognitive function as we age. Risks Understanding the Most Common Threats to Your Lifespan and Healthspan When I talk about risks, I’m referring to a deeper analysis of the factors that slowly chip away at our health over decades— often without us noticing . Such is the silent, insidious nature of the major chronic diseases, and my approach focuses on identifying and mitigating these risks long before they manifest as severe health problems. The Four Horsemen of Chronic Disease My concept of risks revolves around what I call The Four Horsemen of Chronic Disease : heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes. These are the main drivers of death and disability in modern society , and understanding your personal risk factors for each of these conditions is crucial. Cardiovascular Disease Cardiovascular disease remains the number one killer , driven by factors like high apoB levels, hypertension, and inflammation. These are the hidden threats that slowly damage your arteries over time. My approach emphasizes early detection through advanced diagnostics, such as coronary calcium scoring, family history assessments, and detailed lipid analysis, to uncover risks that often go undetected by conventional medical assessments. Cancer Understanding your genetic predispositions, family history, and the role of environmental factors like diet, tobacco, and exposure to cancer-causing agents is critical. I advocate for preventative lifestyle interventions and personalized cancer screening strategies that go beyond standard recommendations, tailored to your unique risk profile. Neurodegenerative Diseases Conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease are devastating, but they don’t happen overnight. Risk factors such as insulin resistance, poor vascular health, and even low sleep quality play a significant role in the development of these diseases. Addressing these early , often through habit modifications and targeted preventive measures, can significantly alter the trajectory of cognitive decline. Metabolic Disorders Type 2 diabetes and related metabolic conditions are among the most preventable yet pervasive chronic diseases. Insulin resistance, poor diet, and lack of physical activity are typical drivers of these disorders, which in turn amplify the risks of heart disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration. The focus here is on proactive management, including glucose monitoring and personalized nutrition and exercise plans aimed at improving and maintaining insulin sensitivity. Tactics An Overview of The 5 Tactics in My Longevity Toolkit In the coming days, you’ll receive dedicated lessons on each of these five tactics . Today, I’ll provide you with a brief introduction to each. Tactics are the specific actions we take to achieve our objectives and implement our strategy. The tactics I emphasize are not just temporary fixes; they are integrated into daily life and designed to enhance both lifespan and healthspan . My approach, which I call Medicine 3.0, moves beyond the reactive nature of traditional medicine (Medicine 2.0) by focusing on prevention, optimization, and personalized interventions. 5 Tactical Domains We address health through five main tactical domains: exercise, nutrition, sleep, emotional health, and medications & supplements Exercise Exercise is the cornerstone of my tactical approach because it impacts both lifespan and healthspan more effectively than any other intervention. However, exercise is not just one thing; it encompasses multiple components: Stability : Ensures that your body can maintain balance and control during movement, reducing the risk of falls and injuries that can severely impact your independence and quality of life as you age. Strength : Preserves muscle mass and power, which are essential for maintaining independence, preventing injuries, and ensuring you can perform daily activities with ease as you age. Aerobic Efficiency (Zone 2 Training): Enhances your body’s ability to utilize oxygen and burn fat, supporting mitochondrial health, cardiovascular function, and metabolic flexibility, all of which are critical for preventing chronic diseases and promoting healthy aging. Peak Aerobic Capacity (VO 2 Max): Directly correlates with your cardiovascular health, metabolic efficiency, and overall physical resilience, significantly reducing the risk of chronic diseases and mortality while enhancing your ability to remain active and independent as you age. I view exercise as the most potent “drug” available for delaying death and preventing cognitive and physical decline. It’s not just about losing weight or improving your physique—it’s about building a robust physical foundation that allows you to live fully in your later years. Nutrition Nutrition plays a critical role in health, but it’s not about adhering to a single diet. Instead, it’s about finding a balance where you’re consuming the right amount of calories and the right types of nutrients to support your body’s needs and long-term objectives. I avoid getting caught up in diet wars or prescribing one-size-fits-all solutions like “low carb” or “vegan.” Instead, I encourage individuals to understand their unique nutritional needs and how to achieve them based on their goals, preferences, and current health status. The idea is to personalize nutrition so it becomes a supportive tactic, not a rigid set of rules. Sleep Sleep is often underestimated , but it’s a critical component of healthspan . Proper sleep supports the body’s innate repair mechanisms, particularly in the brain. Poor sleep, on the other hand, is linked to cognitive decline, metabolic disorders, and decreased emotional resilience. Optimizing sleep means understanding its importance, creating a conducive sleep environment, and prioritizing it just as you would diet or exercise. It’s about quality, consistency, and making sure quality sleep is non-negotiable. Mental & Emotional Health Emotional health is another domain that’s often neglected in Medicine 2.0. Chronic stress, depression, and poor emotional regulation can all significantly impact physical health. My approach includes recognizing and addressing emotional health as a foundational tactic , integrating practices that foster mental well-being, reduce stress, and improve overall quality of life. Whether it’s through therapy, mindfulness, or simply prioritizing social connections, the goal is to maintain emotional resilience as a core element of your health strategy. Medications & Supplements While I emphasize lifestyle changes first, I do not shy away from the use of supplements and pharmaceutical interventions when necessary. In Medicine 3.0, exogenous molecules like lipid-lowering drugs, hormones, or supplements can play an essential role in managing specific health risks. These are tools in our longevity toolkit, used thoughtfully to enhance healthspan and lifespan in ways that lifestyle changes alone may not achieve. Conclusion In this lesson, we’ve explored the foundational principles of longevity through the lens of goals, risks, and tactics. By setting clear objectives with the Marginal Decade ™ and Centenarian Decathlon ™, we can strategically prepare for the later years of life, ensuring they are vibrant and fulfilling. Understanding and managing the risks posed by the Four Horsemen of Chronic Disease allows us to proactively address these threats long before they develop into advanced disease states. Finally, the five tactics—exercise, nutrition, sleep, emotional health, and the use of medications and supplements—provide a practical roadmap for enhancing both lifespan and healthspan . Again, you’ll receive a dedicated lesson on each of these tactics in the coming days. As you continue this journey , remember that these concepts are not just about living longer but living better, with a focus on optimizing every aspect of your health to fully enjoy the years ahead.

My perspective on exercise has evolved significantly over the years; I used to prioritize nutrition above all else, but the data have become increasingly clear: exercise does more to delay death and prevent both cognitive and physical decline than any other intervention available. Unlike other interventions that might target one aspect of health, exercise affects nearly every system in your body. Here’s how I break down exercise as a tactical tool for extending both lifespan and healthspan . The Four Pillars of Exercise Exercise is often used as a broad, catch-all term, but not all exercise is created equal . To maximize the benefits of exercise on longevity, it’s important to focus on four components: stability, strength, aerobic efficiency, and peak aerobic capacity. Each plays a distinct and essential role in maintaining your health as you age. Pillar 1: Stability Stability is often the overlooked but essential foundation that underpins every movement and physical task we perform. In my approach, stability is more than just a buzzword—it’s a critical component that ensures we can safely and effectively carry out the activities that make life meaningful , particularly as we age. What is Stability? Stability is the ability to maintain control of your body’s position , whether you’re moving or stationary. It’s about the subconscious capacity to harness, decelerate, or stop force, allowing you to react to internal or external stimuli without conscious effort. In simpler terms, stability is what keeps you from falling when you trip, helps you maintain balance when lifting, and ensures your joints and muscles work in harmony to prevent injury. Why Stability Matters for Longevity Stability is the bedrock of functional movement, which means it’s crucial for anyone who wants to stay active and independent into old age. Without stability, all the strength in the world won’t protect you from injuries . For example, many so-called “acute” injuries, like a torn ACL or a slipped disc, often have their roots in long-standing stability issues that cause improper movement patterns over time. These weaknesses create small, often unnoticed, stresses on the body that eventually lead to significant injuries. Stability vs. Strength: A Common Misconception A lot of people think that being strong means being stable, but that’s a misconception. You can have significant muscle mass and still lack stability , which means you’re at risk of injury because your body isn’t effectively managing the forces exerted on it. In contrast, someone who has trained for stability may not look as strong, but they’re far more resilient, capable of handling various physical challenges without getting hurt. It’s like comparing a powerful car with poor handling to a well-balanced sports car that can navigate tight turns smoothly; the latter is far less likely to spin out of control. pillar 2: Strength Strength training is not just about looking good—though this can be a nice side effect. Strength is a critical component of longevity, a factor that can determine how well you age and how independent you remain in your later years . As we grow older, our muscle mass naturally declines, a process that begins as early as our thirties and accelerates in our later decades. However, it’s not just the loss of muscle mass that matters, but the loss of muscle strength and power, which can have significant implications for our health and functional ability as we age. Why Strength Matters for Longevity Strength is a predictor of how well you’ll live as you age. Studies have shown that individuals with low muscle strength have a much higher risk of mortality compared to those with greater strength . This association holds true even when adjusting for other factors like cardiovascular fitness and overall health. Simply put, maintaining muscle strength can significantly reduce your risk of death from all causes. But strength is about more than survival— it’s about thriving . Strong muscles protect your joints, improve your balance, and enhance your ability to perform daily activities, from carrying groceries to getting out of a chair. The Mechanics of Strength Strength training involves working your muscles against resistance, which could be anything from bodyweight exercises to lifting heavy weights. When you challenge your muscles in this way, they adapt by becoming stronger and more resilient. This process also stimulates the growth of bone tissue, which is crucial for maintaining bone density and reducing the risk of fractures—another critical aspect of aging well. One of the aspects of strength that I emphasize is its relationship to muscle power, which is the combination of strength and speed . As we age, our fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are responsible for generating power, tend to atrophy faster than our slow-twitch fibers. This decline in power can lead to decreased mobility and an increased risk of falls. Therefore, training to maintain not just strength but also muscle power is essential for preserving functional independence as you age. Strength as a “Retirement Account” for Your Body I often compare strength training to saving for retirement. Just as you want to accumulate financial savings to support you in your later years, you want to build and maintain a “reserve” of muscle and bone density . This reserve acts as a buffer against the inevitable challenges that come with aging. The earlier and more consistently you invest in your strength, the better off you’ll be in the long run. It’s much easier to maintain strength than it is to regain it once it’s lost, especially in older age. pillar 3: Aerobic Efficiency Aerobic efficiency is a component of fitness that plays a crucial role in longevity and overall health. I emphasize the importance of training specifically in what is known as Zone 2—a moderate intensity that optimizes the body’s ability to use both glucose and fat as fuel. Zone 2 training isn’t just about improving athletic performance; it’s a fundamental tactic for enhancing metabolic health, supporting mitochondrial function, and preventing chronic diseases. Understanding Aerobic Efficiency Aerobic efficiency refers to the body’s capacity to efficiently use oxygen during prolonged physical activity, relying primarily on aerobic metabolism. This efficiency is deeply tied to the health of our mitochondria—the cellular “engines” responsible for producing energy. The healthier your mitochondria, the better your body can utilize fat as a primary fuel source , especially at lower intensities. This ability, known as metabolic flexibility, is a critical aspect of overall health, allowing you to shift between burning glucose and fat as needed. Zone 2 Training: What It Is and Why It Matters Zone 2 is a specific intensity of aerobic exercise characterized by a pace that feels on the high end of easy to low end of moderate— you can maintain a conversation, but it might be a bit strained . It’s a pace that can be sustained for long periods without accumulating significant lactate in the blood. This level of effort relies heavily on type 1, or “slow-twitch,” muscle fibers, which are dense with mitochondria and well-suited for endurance work. Zone 2 training is foundational in endurance sports and is used by athletes to build a base of aerobic endurance. However, its benefits extend far beyond athletic performance; it plays a critical role in overall metabolic health, especially for non-athletes. Training in Zone 2 helps improve mitochondrial function, enhances the body’s ability to burn fat, and significantly boosts endurance, making it an essential part of any exercise regimen aimed at longevity. How Zone 2 Training Improves Health Enhances Mitochondrial Health: One of the most powerful effects of Zone 2 training is the stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis—the creation of new, more efficient mitochondria. This adaptation improves your body’s ability to generate energy from fat, reduces reliance on glucose, and lowers the risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. This mitochondrial efficiency is crucial for healthy aging, as a decline in mitochondrial function is one of the hallmarks of aging. What are mitochondria? The primary function of mitochondria is to convert the food you eat into usable energy for your body . They take the nutrients from the food and, through a process called cellular respiration, turn it into a form of energy called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP is like the energy currency that your cells use to power everything they do, from moving muscles to thinking and growing. So, mitochondria are essential for keeping your body energized and functioning properly. Promotes Metabolic Flexibility Zone 2 training helps enhance the body’s ability to switch between burning glucose and fat , a flexibility that’s essential for managing glucose levels and preventing metabolic disorders. For individuals with metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance, Zone 2 exercise can dramatically improve the ability to utilize fat as a fuel source, which is often impaired in these conditions. Supports Cardiovascular and Cognitive Health Aerobic efficiency gained through Zone 2 training improves blood flow not just to the muscles but also to the brain , enhancing cognitive function and helping to prevent neurodegenerative diseases. The training also helps control oxidative stress and inflammation, factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease. pillar 4: Peak Aerobic Capacity (VO 2 Max) Your VO 2 max—peak aerobic capacity—is one of the most powerful predictors of how well and how long you’ll live. Peak aerobic capacity, measured as VO 2 max, reflects the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during exercise. It’s a combined measure of heart, lung, and muscle efficiency, and it plays a critical role in your body’s ability to produce energy during high-intensity efforts. During exercise aimed at improving your VO 2 max, you’re operating at the peak of your aerobic ability, pushing your body’s energy systems to their limits. The higher your VO 2 max , the better your cardiovascular and overall physical fitness, allowing you to perform everyday tasks and maintain a higher quality of life as you age. VO 2 max Training: How It Works Training to improve your VO 2 max involves engaging in high-intensity intervals designed to push your body close to its aerobic limit. Unlike Zone 2 training, which is performed at a moderate, sustainable pace, VO 2 max intervals are shorter but much more intense, typically lasting between three to eight minutes. A common VO 2 max workout consists of four minutes at the maximum sustainable pace, followed by four minutes of active recovery. This cycle is repeated four to six times per session. The goal is to reach a point where you are consuming as much oxygen as possible while still maintaining form and effort. Benefits of VO 2 Max Training Improves cardiovascular and respiratory efficiency VO 2 max training enhances the capacity of your heart, lungs, and muscles to deliver and utilize oxygen more effectively. Increases life expectancy A higher VO 2 max is strongly correlated with reduced all-cause mortality . Studies have shown that individuals with higher VO 2 max scores have significantly lower risks of death at any given age compared to those with lower scores, even when adjusted for other risk factors. For example, moving from the bottom quartile to just below average VO 2 max reduces your mortality risk by nearly 50%. Delays age-related decline in functional capacity Training your VO 2 max helps maintain a level of aerobic fitness that keeps you functionally younger . Improved VO 2 max means that activities that become difficult with age, such as climbing stairs or brisk walking, remain within your capabilities well into your later decades. Boosts metabolic flexibility Besides enhancing aerobic capacity, VO 2 max training also improves your body’s ability to switch between energy sources (glucose and fat), which is crucial for metabolic health . This metabolic flexibility helps prevent conditions like insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Supports cognitive health High-intensity aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain, supporting cognitive function and potentially reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Conclusion Exercise is more than just a task on a to-do list; it is the most potent longevity tactic we have . By embracing a holistic approach that targets stability, strength, aerobic efficiency, and peak aerobic capacity, you can build a robust physical foundation that supports a longer, healthier, and more fulfilling life.

Instead, my approach is rooted in what can be measured and tailored to the individual. Nutrition is incredibly personal—what works optimally for one person may not be ideal for another. Factors such as body composition, activity level, personal preferences, and metabolic health all play a significant role in determining the most effective dietary strategy for each individual. The key is to focus on measurable outcomes and adapt the diet to suit your unique needs, preferences, and goals. My emphasis is on managing quantifiable health metrics that can be modulated by nutrition—such as insulin sensitivity, body composition, and muscle mass—because these are the factors that most directly influence your healthspan and lifespan . This pragmatic approach allows us to tailor dietary strategies to achieve specific goals, whether reducing visceral fat, improving metabolic health, or maintaining muscle mass. By focusing on what can be measured, we can make informed adjustments to optimize both nutrition and overall health, ensuring that dietary choices are not just sustainable, but also effective in promoting longevity. My 2×2 Framework My 2×2 framework is a simple yet powerful tool that helps you understand where you stand in terms of nutrition and muscle health. It breaks down into four quadrants based on two dimensions: Nutritional status (overnourished vs. undernourished) This dimension reflects whether an individual is consuming more calories than they need (overnourished) or not enough (undernourished). Overnourishment often leads to excess body fat, particularly visceral fat, which is a significant risk factor for metabolic diseases. Muscle mass (adequately muscled vs. undermuscled) This dimension considers whether an individual has sufficient muscle mass (adequately muscled) or inadequate muscle mass (undermuscled). Muscle mass plays an important role in metabolic health, insulin sensitivity, and overall resilience as we age. Based on these two dimensions, there are four possible quadrants into which an individual might fall: Overnourished and undermuscled : This is the most concerning quadrant, where an individual is consuming more calories than they need while also lacking adequate muscle mass. This combination is a recipe for metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and a host of other chronic diseases. Overnourished and adequately muscled : While having adequate muscle mass is certainly beneficial, being overnourished can still present significant health risks. Excess caloric intake, even in someone with good muscle mass, can lead to increased visceral fat and metabolic dysfunction. This combination highlights the importance of balancing nutrition with exercise to ensure that muscle mass is maintained without accumulating excess fat that can compromise overall health.is essential for overall health, longevity, and quality of life. Undernourished and undermuscled : Insufficient calorie and protein intake results in muscle loss, decreased strength, and impaired metabolic function, leaving the body vulnerable to frailty, injury, and chronic diseases. This condition underscores the critical need for adequate nutrition and regular strength training to build and maintain muscle mass, which is essential for overall health, longevity, and quality of life.that muscle mass is maintained without accumulating excess fat that can compromise overall health. Undernourished and adequately muscled : This scenario is extremely rare because maintaining adequate muscle mass requires sufficient nutrition, particularly protein and calories. It’s unlikely to find someone who is undernourished yet still has adequate muscle mass, as the lack of proper nutrition typically leads to muscle loss and diminished strength over time. Addressing the Overnourished and Undermuscled Quadrant To move out of the “overnourished and undermuscled” quadrant, the focus should be on two strategies: 1. Reducing body fat This involves reducing excess caloric intake, particularly from low-quality, nutrient-poor foods, and shifting towards a balanced diet that supports metabolic health without contributing to fat accumulation. As I see it, there are three approaches that can be used to reduce total calorie intake: Caloric Restriction (CR) CR involves reducing your total daily calorie intake, without any real emphasis on the composition of your macronutrients, food groups, or meal timing. This is the most direct means of creating a calorie deficit–meaning you consume fewer calories than you burn, leading to weight loss. Dietary Restriction (DR) DR focuses on limiting or eliminating specific types of food or macronutrients from your diet, such as carbohydrates, fats, or processed foods. For example, a low-carb or ketogenic diet is a form of DR where the intake of carbohydrates is significantly reduced. This form of restriction can reduce overall calorie intake, though care must be taken to ensure adequate intake of all micro- and macronutrients. Time Restriction (TR) TR, often referred to as time-restricted eating or intermittent fasting, involves limiting your eating window to a specific number of hours each day, such as 8 hours of eating followed by 16 hours of fasting. TR doesn’t necessarily change what you eat, but rather when you eat. By compressing your eating window, TR can naturally lead to a reduction in caloric intake, which aids in fat loss. 2. Building Muscle Mass Strength training and adequate protein intake should be a priority, as these help increase muscle mass, improve insulin sensitivity, and boost overall metabolic rate. This shift not only addresses the undermuscled aspect but also helps mitigate the risks associated with overnourishment. Managing Metabolic Health and Preventing Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic health is a critical component of any plan which aims to maximize lifespan and healthspan . Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions —including insulin resistance, high blood pressure, high glucose, elevated cholesterol levels, and excess body fat around the waist—that dramatically increase the risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even neurodegenerative conditions. Addressing and preventing metabolic syndrome is not just about managing these individual risk factors; it’s about taking a proactive approach to maintain overall metabolic health. Insulin Sensitivity Insulin sensitivity is at the heart of metabolic health. When cells have healthy sensitivity to insulin, they can effectively use glucose for energy , keeping glucose levels stable and preventing the excessive insulin production that leads to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a central driver of metabolic syndrome, so maintaining or improving insulin sensitivity is crucial. Monitoring and Managing Glucose Levels One of the most direct ways to assess and manage metabolic health is by monitoring glucose levels. Chronically elevated glucose can lead to a host of problems, including damage to blood vessels, nerves, and organs. It’s also a sign that your metabolic system is under stress, potentially leading to or exacerbating metabolic syndrome. Visceral Fat Visceral fat, fat stored around your organs , is a significant driver of metabolic syndrome. Visceral fat is more metabolically active than subcutaneous fat (the fat under your skin) and produces inflammatory cytokines that contribute to insulin resistance and other metabolic issues. Reducing visceral fat is therefore a priority for preventing metabolic syndrome and maintaining metabolic health. Protein Matters Protein plays an indispensable role in health, especially in maintaining muscle mass, strength, and overall metabolic health as we age. Low protein diets can accelerate the loss of muscle mass and strength as you age , one of the most important predictors of long-term health and functional independence. Without adequate protein intake, you risk sarcopenia—a condition that leads to frailty, increased risk of falls, and a decline in overall quality of life. Protein Intake: How Much is Enough? While protein needs can vary depending on factors like age and activity level, I generally recommend higher protein intake as we age , in the range of 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. This amount supports muscle protein synthesis and helps maintain lean body mass, which is critical for staying active and independent in later years. I’m aware that some “experts” have raised concerns about protein’s impact on lifespan and disease risk. We’ve addressed these issues exhaustively on podcasts and in premium articles, all of which you can explore below. Conclusion Nutrition is a powerful tool for longevity, but it’s not about following the latest dietary trend or adhering to oppressive rules that reduce your quality of life. Instead, it’s about finding the balance that works best for you—a balance that supports insulin sensitivity, preserves muscle mass, and ensures a steady supply of essential nutrients . By focusing on these core principles and tailoring them to your individual needs, you can use nutrition not just to live longer, but to live better, with health and functionality that lasts well into your later years.

For years, I operated under the misguided belief that sleep was expendable —something I could sacrifice without consequence. “I’ll sleep when I’m dead” was more than just a saying for me; it was practically a mantra. This approach carried me through my teens, twenties, and well into my thirties, but looking back, I now see the toll it took on my performance and health. In high school, I had a relentless drive to excel, particularly in sports. I’d often stay up late to fit in extra workouts, only to wake up at the crack of dawn to do it all over again. It wasn’t just a phase— it became a pattern that followed me into college and medical school. My days were packed with studying, training, and working, and sleep was always the first thing to be sacrificed. The true cost of this sleep deprivation hit me hard during my residency. The demands of medical training are brutal, and sleep is often viewed as a luxury. I remember two occasions vividly when the lack of sleep caught up with me in the most alarming way: I fell asleep in the operating room. Fortunately, no harm was done, but those incidents were a wake-up call—literally and figuratively. They were acute examples of how sleep deprivation can push anyone to their limits , and in situations where the stakes couldn’t be higher. These experiences forced me to reevaluate my relationship with sleep. It became clear that neglecting sleep wasn’t a badge of honor or a testament to my work ethic— it was a serious risk to my health and my ability to function at the level that I demanded of myself and that I owed to my patients. It wasn’t until my early 40s that I finally understood that sleep wasn’t something I could afford to neglect any longer. It is, in fact, one of the most crucial pillars of health. What we’ve learned from studying sleep One of the great advantages we have in understanding sleep is that, unlike many other aspects of human physiology, sleep is relatively easy to study in controlled environments. This has allowed researchers to explore the intricate details of how sleep impacts our health with a level of precision that’s harder to achieve in other areas of study. The study of sleep benefits from several unique factors. First, sleep is a universal behavior—everyone does it, and it follows a predictable cycle. This consistency makes it easier to design studies and compare results across different populations. Additionally, sleep can be monitored in a controlled environment, such as a sleep lab, where variables like light, temperature, and noise can be tightly regulated. This control allows researchers to isolate specific aspects of sleep and their effects on the body and mind. Technological advancements have also aided in obtaining detailed insights into what happens when we sleep. Tools like polysomnography (PSG), which records brain waves, oxygen levels, heart rate, and breathing during sleep, and actigraphy, which monitors movement, have enabled us to observe and quantify different stages of sleep—such as REM and deep sleep—and their respective roles in health. What we Know About the Impact of Poor Sleep on Health Thanks to these studies, we’ve learned a tremendous amount about the critical role sleep plays in our overall health. Here are the most significant findings : Short-Term Consequences of Poor Sleep In the short term, poor sleep can manifest in several ways that most of us have experienced at some point: Cognitive Impairment One of the most immediate effects of sleep deprivation is a decline in cognitive function. This includes reduced attention, slower reaction times, impaired memory, and difficulty concentrating . Even a single night of poor sleep can leave you feeling mentally foggy, making it harder to perform at your best. Mood Disruptions Poor sleep often leads to irritability, increased stress, and emotional instability. The relationship between sleep and mood is bidirectional —lack of sleep can worsen mood, and stress or anxiety can further disrupt sleep, creating a vicious cycle. Physical Performance Sleep is crucial for physical recovery, and without it, your ability to perform both mentally and physically declines. You may experience reduced strength, slower reflexes, and decreased endurance , which can impact everything from your workouts to your daily activities and may increase risk of accidental injuries. Metabolic Disruption Even short-term sleep deprivation can lead to temporary insulin resistance, increased hunger, and cravings for high-calorie, sugary foods . This metabolic disruption, if repeated over time, can lead to weight gain and an increased risk of developing metabolic disorders. Long-Term Consequences of Poor Sleep The long-term consequences of chronic sleep deprivation are even more concerning, significantly increasing the risk of several serious health conditions: Cardiovascular Disease Chronic sleep deprivation is a well-established risk factor for hypertension, heart disease, and stroke . Poor sleep affects regulation of blood pressure and inflammation , contributing to the development of cardiovascular diseases that can shorten lifespan . Metabolic Disorders Consistently poor sleep disrupts metabolic processes , leading to insulin resistance and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Adequate sleep is thus essential for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing metabolic syndrome. Neurodegenerative Diseases Long-term sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease . During sleep, the brain clears out toxic compounds, including beta-amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer’s. Without sufficient sleep, this cleansing process is impaired, potentially accelerating cognitive decline. Immunosuppression Poor sleep weakens the immune system , making the body more susceptible to infections and slowing recovery from illness. Over time, this can contribute to chronic inflammation, which is a common pathway in the development of many diseases, including cancer. Mental Health Issues Chronic sleep deprivation is closely linked to mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety . The lack of restorative sleep can exacerbate symptoms of these conditions and increase the risk of severe mental health crises. Conclusion Sleep is not just a passive state of rest— it’s a critical pillar of health that impacts every aspect of our lives, from cognitive function and metabolic health to immune defense and long-term disease prevention . My journey from dismissing sleep as expendable to recognizing its irreplaceable value has taught me that sleep deprivation is not just a temporary inconvenience; it’s a serious risk to both lifespan and healthspan . The research is clear: optimizing sleep is one of the most powerful tactics we have for living a longer, healthier, and more fulfilling life. Prioritizing sleep isn’t just about avoiding fatigue—it’s about safeguarding your future.

It wasn’t something I spent much time thinking about. That all changed when my therapist, Esther Perel, asked me a question that stopped me in my tracks : “Do you find it ironic that you spend so much time focused on how to live longer, yet no time at all trying to be less miserable?” Her question hit home. What’s the point of living longer if you’re not happy, and perhaps more importantly, if the people you care about aren’t happy when you’re around? Our emotional health and the quality of our relationships are deeply intertwined. The more we dwell in our own mental suffering, the more we end up spreading that misery to those around us. On the flip side, when we take care of our emotional well-being , we’re able to show up for the people we love in a meaningful way. Emotional health is arguably the most challenging aspect of health to quantify. We don’t have scans or biomarkers to provide clear answers about our current state, progress, or regression. The best “metrics” we might have are two simple questions : On average, how do I feel? On average, how do I make the people around me feel? Unlike for cognitive and physical health, there is no biological phenomenon that would cause emotional health to decline with age. In fact, there’s no reason it can’t improve as we grow older . Emotional health is often relegated to the sidelines, dismissed as a “soft” factor that doesn’t carry the same weight as biomarkers or fitness metrics. For years, I focused primarily on the tangible aspects of health—things I could measure, track, and optimize. I meticulously monitored my diet, spent hours in the gym, and worked hard to optimize my sleep. But I didn’t pay nearly enough attention to my emotional health, and I suspect I’m not alone in that oversight. Beyond simply adding to quality of life, emotional well-being also facilitates engagement in nearly all other tactics on this list. Admittedly, I’m not speaking as an expert on this topic. I’m more of a student in this area, inviting you to join me on this part of the journey . I’ve had many conversations on the podcast with guests that have unique expertise, insights, and tools for improving emotional health. I’ve linked to many of them below and encourage you to watch or listen. Conclusion It’s not enough to focus solely on the physical aspects of health; true longevity requires a holistic approach that includes emotional well-being. In the end, it’s about integrating all these elements into a cohesive strategy for living well. Emotional health isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s a must-have if we’re serious about longevity. By prioritizing emotional health, we dramatically improve our healthspan , without which, extended lifespan might feel like more of a curse than a blessing.

Just like with diets, many people are on the lookout for a one-size-fits-all solution that simply doesn’t exist. The reality is far more complex, and the path to increased lifespan and improved healthspan requires a multifaceted approach. Over the years, I’ve noticed that people generally fall into one of three distinct categories when it comes to their attitudes toward medications and supplements: Some individuals are eager to take any medication or supplement that promises health benefits, yet they shy away from making fundamental changes to their diet or exercise routine . They’re looking for a shortcut, hoping that a pill can substitute for the hard work of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. On the other end of the spectrum, some people are committed to improving their diet and exercise habits but are resistant to the idea of taking any medications or supplements . They believe that lifestyle changes alone should be sufficient and are wary of introducing any exogenous molecules. Others are open to experimenting with over-the-counter supplements but are hesitant to use prescription drugs . They often perceive supplements as a safer, more natural choice, while viewing pharmaceuticals as an unacceptable option. If our ultimate goal is to extend our lifespan and maximize our healthspan , we need to be open to using all the tools at our disposal . This means embracing a comprehensive approach that includes nutrition optimization, commitment to regular exercise, and willingness to consider the use of prescription drugs and high-quality supplements when they are appropriate. A filter for medications & supplements Unlike other aspects of health like sleep or exercise where broad guidelines can be applied—for example, recommending eight hours of sleep over three— medications and supplements are far more individualized . The effectiveness and safety of these interventions depend on a wide array of factors, including an individual’s medical history, family medical history, current health status, lab results, age, sex, lifestyle, and personal health objectives. Without this detailed information, it’s impossible to make generalized recommendations about which medications or supplements someone should take, let alone the appropriate dosage, timing, or duration of use. These decisions must be made at the individual level , preferably within the context of a doctor-patient relationship, where there is a comprehensive understanding of the patient’s unique situation and a means of monitoring the effects of the intervention over time. That said, here are three questions that anyone should consider when evaluating the use of any medication or supplement: 1. What is the objective? The more clearly you can define your objective, the better you can assess whether a particular medication or supplement is the right tool for achieving that goal. Understanding the purpose behind the intervention is the first step in making an informed decision. 2. Is there a biomarker? How do you plan to customize, track, and adjust your treatment over time? If a biomarker exists to measure effectiveness, it can be a valuable tool for monitoring progress. If there isn’t one, it doesn’t necessarily mean you shouldn’t proceed, but it does require a more intentional approach to monitoring results through other means. 3. Does the risk outweigh the reward? Every individual has a different tolerance for risk. When evaluating risk versus reward, consider the following : Is the mechanism of action well understood? How much clinical experience exists with this medication or supplement? What are the short- and long-term risks of taking it? What are the risks of not taking it? By carefully considering these questions, you can make more informed decisions about the role that medications and supplements might play in your overall strategy. Remember, there’s no magic elixir , but with the right approach, you can leverage these tools effectively as part of a broader, personalized plan for health optimization. Majoring in the minor: a word of caution In the pursuit of optimal health, it’s easy to get caught up in the allure of quick fixes—whether it’s the latest supplement, an off-label drug, or some trendy new therapy. But before we dive into these interventions, it’s crucial to focus on the big levers that truly move the needle : nutrition, sleep, exercise, and emotional health. Imagine you’re a student preparing for final exams . Instead of focusing on the core subjects that make up 90% of your grade, you spend most of your time studying obscure facts that might, if you’re lucky, account for just 1% of the questions. Here’s another analogy –picture yourself as the captain of the Titanic, and instead of addressing the iceberg in your path, you’re busy rearranging the deck chairs to make everything appear tidy. This might make you feel like you’re doing something productive but, in reality, you’re ignoring the critical issue while the ship is headed for catastrophe. Cases certainly exist in which objective measures—whether it’s lab results, screenings, or tools like blood pressure monitoring–point to a clear and immediate indication for a drug or supplement. It’s entirely appropriate to act on that information right away. For instance, if someone has a critically low level of a vital nutrient, or if their blood pressure is dangerously high, a targeted intervention might be necessary. But even in these cases, such measures should be taken alongside efforts to improve the big levers of health. The key is not to let these interventions distract from the bigger picture. No supplement or drug will fully compensate for a poor diet, chronic sleep deprivation, or a sedentary lifestyle . These are the major factors that determine our long-term health outcomes. If they’re not being addressed, adding supplements or medications is akin to rearranging those deck chairs—cosmetic changes that don’t address the impending catastrophe. Conclusion While the allure of quick fixes is strong, enduring health is built on a foundation of good nutrition, consistent exercise, quality sleep, and tending to emotional health. Supplements and medications have their place, but they should never be a substitute for these fundamentals. Instead of majoring in the minor, focus on the big levers that truly matter. When interventions are necessary, they should be based on clear, individualized evidence and used as part of a comprehensive approach to health. The goal is not just to live longer but to live better, and that requires getting the fundamentals right.

In light of a recent study reporting a correlation between increased REM sleep latency (the amount of time between becoming unconscious and entering REM sleep) and the severity of neurodegenerative biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 1 some health influencers believe the answer is “yes” — and they’ve even gone so far as to advocate for using REM sleep latency measurements from one’s home sleep trackers as a biomarker for brain health. However, while the study may have provided a small piece of information about the relationship between neurodegeneration and sleep architecture, trying to use the study to evaluate or intervene on one’s own health based on REM sleep latency is a waste of time at best. Specifics of the study This cross-sectional study examined 128 adults (mean age: 70.8 years; 56.9% female), of which 64 had Alzheimer’s disease, 41 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 23 were cognitively normal. Individuals with certain known sleep disorders or forms of dementia other than AD or MCI (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) were excluded. The investigators used overnight polysomnography (PSG) to evaluate sleep architecture, with metrics including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, REM latency, and time spent in each sleep stage. To evaluate the severity of AD pathophysiology, they assessed three plasma biomarkers of AD (p-tau181, NfL, BDNF) and employed positron emission tomography (PET) to quantitate amyloid β (Aβ) deposition. After adjusting for confounding variables such as age, sex, BMI, and APOE-ε4 status, the researchers found a handful of significant associations between various sleep parameters and AD pathology. While most of these associations were abolished after applying corrections for multiple comparisons (an essential adjustment to avoid false positives; explained in more detail here ), two remained statistically significant — both of which related to the metric of REM latency. Specifically, they found that, compared with those in the lowest tertile of REM sleep latency (<98.2 min), those in the highest tertile (>192.7 min) had higher PET Aβ burdens (β=0.07; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.12) and reduced BDNF levels (β=−0.50; 95% CI: −0.69, −0.19). Based on these data, the authors propose that extended REM sleep latency might be an early warning sign of neurodegenerative disease and may have value in tracking progression of AD. Some health influencers have taken this interpretation a step further, advising their audiences to use their at-home wearable sleep trackers to self-diagnose their own Aβ burdens. But before you run off to pore through your sleep data and put a neurologist on speed dial, let’s take a closer look at these claims — and why they are deeply unserious. The direction of the causal arrow As I mentioned at the outset, yes, sleep absolutely influences long-term cognitive health. But here’s the kicker — cognitive health also influences sleep . All forms of dementia involve dramatic changes to the brain’s structure and function, and disruptions in sleep timing and sleep architecture are observed in all types of neurodegeneration. Specifically, there is an extremely high prevalence of sleep disorders observed in AD, and dysregulation of sleep is one of the most common and difficult to manage symptoms of AD. 2 The finding that the severity of AD pathology is correlated with increased REM sleep latency is thus not particularly surprising given the known (and almost certainly causal) role that neurodegenerative diseases play in sleep dysfunction. Should we be concerned about the possibility of a causal connection going the other direction? That is, should we be concerned that longer REM sleep latency per se might increase one’s risk of developing cognitive decline or dementia? Again, ensuring adequate quality sleep is one of the most important things you can do to protect your brain, but critically, this study provides no evidence that REM sleep latency in particular is any more or less important than any other sleep parameter in this respect. As a purely observational study, it can’t provide any evidence that the REM sleep latency (or any other aspect of sleep) has any impact on cognitive trajectories. It demonstrates nothing about causality. Is REM latency a marker of cognitive health? Still, putting the question of causality aside, what about the claim that REM latency might be uniquely valuable as a marker of cognitive health or AD progression? Here, too, this study falls short. Not only was this an observational study, it was a cross-sectional observational study, meaning that it simply looked at data from one snapshot in time. The researchers did not examine changes in REM sleep latency over time and how they tracked with the development or progression of neurodegenerative disorders. It was merely an observation that those with more severe AD pathology appear to have longer REM sleep latency. Further, most of the participants in this study already had AD or MCI, at which point reverse causality (i.e., neurodegenerative disease causing extended REM latency) becomes extremely likely. So even if REM sleep might serve as a marker of disease progression in those with baseline AD, it makes little sense to extrapolate this finding to make the recommendation that cognitively normal people should monitor their cognitive health by tracking REM latency. In no way does this work provide evidence that REM sleep latency differences in those who are healthy are correlated with risk of developing neurodegenerative disease. Indeed, REM sleep latency is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon such that even saying whether a “shorter” or “longer” latency is good or bad is impossible. Many disorders, such as major depression and narcolepsy, involve shortened REM sleep latency. Sleep apnea, medication use, stress, chronic inflammation, and myriad other factors also affect REM sleep latency in diverse ways which may themselves impact neurodegenerative disease. To illustrate this point, consider the fact that sleep deprivation itself also tends to shorten REM sleep latency. The conclusions made by the study authors (and the social media claims surrounding this study) would imply that someone who is chronically sleep-deprived — but who therefore has relatively short REM sleep latency — would be cognitively healthier than someone who regularly gets sufficient sleep but whose REM latency is a bit longer. This, of course, is absurd, yet it demonstrates why REM sleep latency on its own has no utility as a biomarker for cognitive health or neurodegenerative disease progression . Limitations of at-home wearables A separate but important point to keep in mind concerns the limitations of at-home wearables, such as watches and rings, that purport to track your sleep. Data from this study derived from polysomnography tests performed in a sleep clinic, not from wearable sleep trackers. So even if we put aside the countless other problems, the notion that this study justifies making at-home judgements about cognitive health based on personal sleep trackers is a step too far. These wearable devices will often report your sleep architecture (which is to say, how much and when you experienced various phases of sleep), and they can sometimes provide interesting and useful data in specific circumstances, but information gathered from them should be taken with a large grain of salt. They are not a replacement for polysomnography, and should not be used for making medical decisions. These devices all use different technology to track sleep and different algorithms to assess sleep architecture, and whether they are able to accurately measure REM sleep latency at all is unclear. A red herring for cognitive health tracking We know sleep is vital for cognitive health. So when a study comes along that suggests a particular aspect of sleep — namely, REM sleep latency — has unique value in tracking cognitive trajectories and neurodegenerative disease, it may be tempting to scan through your sleep tracker data and panic if this specific metric appears a little off-target. Yet in reality, this study is a far cry from providing clinically actionable insights capable of guiding treatment decisions or lifestyle changes. Yes, sleep quality — of which REM sleep latency is just a single element — has an impact on cognitive health, but the brain changes that accompany neurodegenerative disorders also have an impact on sleep, potentially including REM sleep latency. The latter impact is just as likely as (if not more likely than) the former to explain the results of the present study, so we have no evidence that targeting an optimal REM sleep latency will in any way improve cognitive trajectories or reduce AD risk. Indeed, this study doesn’t even offer real evidence that using REM sleep latency as a biomarker of cognitive health has any utility whatsoever, especially for those who are healthy. So in this case, the alarm over REM latency and neurodegenerative disease is little more than a red herring — just another drop in an endless sea of misinterpreted information.

Even with disciplined habits and strong motivation, the body often seems to push back. Why? A new study sheds light on this frustration, suggesting that fat cells might retain a molecular “memory” of obesity, long after you’ve lost weight. 1 Much media coverage has interpreted this discovery as validation for the hopelessness of weight loss, but is this conclusion merited? While this study does offer crucial insights into how biology can subtly influence your metabolic health, a closer examination reveals key questions still remaining. The molecular echo of obesity Researchers Hinte et al. explored whether obesity leaves a biological imprint, not by changing DNA itself, but through epigenetic modifications — molecular changes that alter how the genes of DNA are expressed . Their findings reveal that obesity might imprint fat cells in ways that linger, even after significant weight loss. In their study, the scientists analyzed gene expression in adipose tissue samples from individuals with severe obesity who had undergone bariatric surgery and had maintained at least a 25% reduction in BMI two years after the procedure. They compared gene expression from these samples with samples from participants prior to surgery-induced weight loss as well as with samples obtained from lean, never-obese controls. The results were striking: the previously obese individuals’ fat cells (adipocytes) continued to behave abnormally even two years after weight loss. In both pre- and post-weight loss adipose tissue samples, pathways related to the metabolism and function of adipocytes were consistently expressed less , while those related to fibrosis and cell death were expressed more , than non-obese controls. In other words, certain dysregulations in gene expression associated with obesity do not resolve with weight loss, such that the cells behave as if they “remember” being obese. To dig deeper into the molecular unpinnings of this “memory,” Hinte et al. turned to mechanistic experiments in mice. Excess weight gain was induced in adult mice by feeding them a high-fat diet for a period of either 12 or 25 weeks, after which the mice were switched to a standard chow diet, resulting in weight loss. As controls, separate groups of mice were fed with standard chow continuously to remain lean throughout the experiment. Even after high-fat-fed mice returned to a healthy weight, fat cells retained epigenetic markers linked to inflammation and impaired fat storage, similar to the phenotype in the human samples. Overall, most of the downregulated (57–62%) and upregulated (68–75%) differentially expressed genes could be explained by at least one of the studied epigenetic factors. The convergence of mouse and human data suggest that adipocytes indeed retain many epigenetic features of an obese phenotype. But what are the practical consequences of this type of “memory” of obesity? When these formerly obese mice faced a high-fat diet again, they regained weight nearly twice as fast as mice who had never been obese. After this second high-fat diet period, the epigenetic signatures could account for 31% of upregulated and 60% of downregulated differentially expressed genes. Adipose tissue also exhibited greater glucose and fatty acid uptake compared to lean controls,\\xa0as well as showing impaired development of new, healthy fat cells (or “adipogenesis”). Impairments in adipogenesis can lead to dysfunctional fat storage, with lipids spilling into non-adipose tissues (like liver or muscle) and creating an inflammatory environment that often precedes metabolic disease. Taken together, these findings suggest that obesity imprints a lasting molecular signature on adipose tissue. Even after weight loss, these changes persist and may predispose the body to respond more aggressively to future high-fat or high-calorie exposure, priming the body for metabolically unhealthy fat storage. But does this “memory” actually cause weight regain? Translating fat cell memory into practical insights Despite the compelling findings that fat cells show a form of “memory” for obesity, these data don’t show that weight regain is attributable to epigenetic changes within fat cells themselves. It is true that the difficulty keeping weight off after weight loss has a biological basis, and it is currently understood to involve disrupted leptin signaling. Leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells, signals to the brain that the body is satiated and has sufficient energy stores in the form of fat. After significant weight loss, leptin levels drop sharply, prompting the brain to react as though the body is starving (even if ample fat mass is still present), thereby increasing hunger and food cravings and reducing energy expenditure (for more detail on leptin and its role in weight dynamics, refer to my podcast episode with Dr. Rudy Leibel ). Because leptin originates from fat cells, it is plausible that adipose tissue epigenetic alterations such as those identified by Hinte et al. could influence leptin dynamics and thus indirectly drive weight regain. However, the present study did not investigate this possibility, so future work is necessary to establish this causal link. So if we can’t be sure that epigenetic changes contribute to weight regain, we’re left with the question: what does this study tell us? At most, it suggests that adipose tissue in formerly obese individuals retains a pro-inflammatory, metabolically altered phenotype. So while the maintained features don’t fully explain why people regain weight, they could explain why previously obese individuals remain more vulnerable to metabolic diseases — even after maintaining weight loss. As an analogy, we can imagine fat cell memory as akin to a knee injury. Injuring your knee might not cause re-injury, but it has the potential lasting consequence of pain and stiffness. As such, it is plausible that conditions such as insulin resistance, fatty liver, and abnormal fat storage are all more likely if this epigenetic “memory” persists. Other practical questions remain open: the human data came from individuals who were sufficiently obese to merit bariatric surgery and dropped in BMI by at least 25%, but will similar molecular changes occur with less dramatic weight loss? And do epigenetic changes continue indefinitely, or could fat cells eventually “forget” their past? In short: this isn’t a story about weight regulation. It’s a story about metabolic resilience — or the lack thereof — in the post-obese state. And that’s a meaningful message, albeit a very different one from the headlines that have surrounded this study to date. Weight loss is still beneficial for health At first consideration, the finding that weight reduction fails to reverse various pathological features of obesity can make any weight loss efforts seem hopeless. But it’s important to recognize that this study was not designed to capture the many, many established ways in which reduction in fat mass does improve metabolic, cardiovascular, mental, and cognitive health. Fat cells might retain a molecular memory, but that is a far cry from indicating that weight loss does not have numerous, profound benefits for health and well-being. Indeed, even the possibility [as yet untested] that these epigenetic changes might increase risk of weight regain should reinforce , not diminish, your commitment to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, as maintaining a lean state following obesity will require dedicated effort — but those efforts pay clear, long-term dividends.

Many who experience it are familiar with a cycle of hope and disappointment — trying physical therapies, adjusting posture, diligently performing stretches and exercises, only to find relief to be temporary at best. It’s almost as though something fundamental has been overlooked. Indeed, research strongly suggests exactly that. While chronic back pain is often viewed as just a physical malfunction waiting to be mechanically repaired, it is instead a multidimensional experience connected with our emotions, thoughts, and everyday interactions. Consider, for instance, how stress and anxiety amplify our perception of pain, prolonging episodes that might otherwise be brief. This mind-body connection, which underlies the “biopsychosocial model” of chronic pain, is a growing area of interest, and, as a 2023 study by Bemani et al. suggests, it holds promising implications for treatment of low back pain. 1 A multidimensional approach to treating pain Bemani et al. explored whether integrating psychological strategies into physiotherapy would yield better pain reduction compared to traditional physiotherapy alone. Seventy participants with moderate chronic low back pain (defined as self-reported pain between a 3 and 7 on a scale of 1 to 10 and lasting for at least 3 months) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to standard physiotherapy or a multidimensional therapy approach. Standard physiotherapy included structured education on spinal anatomy, muscle-strengthening exercises, and passive treatments like ultrasound and electrotherapy, whereas the multidimensional therapy included these interventions plus psychological techniques based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). These techniques involved understanding pain neuroscience (for those curious, they based this on the book Explain Pain 2 ) , developing coping strategies, managing anxiety, and gradually confronting movements they previously feared. Treatment sessions actively engaged patients, with frequent discussions and tailored home assignments designed to reinforce new skills. Both groups participated in two treatment sessions per week for six weeks. Initially, both groups improved along similar trajectories, with average pain scores falling from about 5 out of 10 down to roughly 2 out of 10 by the end of the 6-week treatment (control baseline=5.03±0.95; experimental baseline=5.03±0.92; control 6-week=2.43±1.85; experimental 6-week=1.86±1.65). While the experimental group demonstrated a slightly greater drop, this difference between groups was not statistically significant, so based on these results, we might be tempted to view psychological interventions as merely an added bonus with no substantial impact on the patients’ experience of pain itself. However, participants were then followed for a number of weeks after the end of 6-week interventions, and this post-treatment period revealed divergence between the two groups. By 10 weeks from the study start, the control group’s pain score began to rise while the experimental group remained steady (control 10-week=3.29±2.01; experimental 10-week=1.74±1.74) — a moderate but statistically significant between-group difference. This trend continued, and at the 22-week timepoint, the control group again had increased in average pain score and the experimental group had not (control 22-week=3.86±2.35; experimental 22-week=1.66±2.00). Statistically, the difference at this final timepoint was considered a large between-group effect (effect size =-0.89; 95% CI=-1.38 to -0.39). Notably, the study found comparable improvements in disability scores across both groups. Physical functioning (e.g., walking, bending, performing daily tasks) improved similarly, irrespective of treatment type. Interpreting these results Overall, Bemani et al. ’s results indicate that standard physiotherapy and a multidimensional approach perform comparably in temporary pain alleviation, but only the latter fundamentally alters the underlying processes perpetuating chronic discomfort. The more holistic approach seemed to equip patients with enduring tools to manage pain flare-ups and stressors, thereby transforming their long-term relationship with pain. Chronic pain isn’t just about physical function; it’s about how we interpret, respond to, and manage discomfort when it arises. While physical interventions help restore muscle and joint function, psychological strategies may change how individuals experience and relate to pain — which perhaps explains why the two interventions did not differ in results with respect to disability scores. Interestingly, this explanation is somewhat at odds with the fact that the study reported no between-group differences in pain catastrophizing (thoughts that magnify the experience of pain) and kinesiophobia (fear of movement). The lack of significance on these secondary outcomes may reflect an insufficient sample size, or perhaps these specific negative thought patterns do not underlie the benefit of psychological treatment on pain. Additionally, while the improvements with a multidimensional approach are encouraging, it is important to remember that this was a small-scale study with limited diversity among participants. The study was restricted to those between the ages of 18-50, yet chronic low back pain is increasingly prevalent with age, so it will be important to determine how the addition of psychological techniques might improve pain management in those over 50. Further, those with anxiety or depression were excluded from the study, and since these conditions are often comorbid with chronic pain and often treated in part with CBT, it would be interesting to see if this group might benefit more from a multidimensional approach to pain treatment than what was observed in this study cohort. Regardless, these data demonstrate that integrating psychological interventions can meaningfully enhance the effectiveness of chronic pain management — despite leaving us with questions as to precisely how they have this effect and how it might vary across different individuals. Real-word application So why is it that a biopsychological approach to pain management is not yet the standard of care? Any new therapy takes time and extensive study before it’s fully accepted and adopted by the medical community, but some barriers to implementing multidimensional care in routine practice may also relate to broader perceptions at the societal and individual level. Patients might initially feel skeptical about incorporating psychological treatments into pain management, perhaps interpreting it as a suggestion that their pain is “all in their head.” Shifting this perspective is vital. Pain science, as discussed recently on The Drive by Dr. Sean Mackey , unequivocally supports the interplay of mind and body. The emotional and psychological elements don’t diminish the reality of physical pain; rather, they represent a crucial dimension that we must address explicitly. What’s more encouraging is that integrating these psychological approaches doesn’t necessarily require specialized mental health practitioners in every case. Many physiotherapists can be trained to implement basic psychological and educational techniques effectively — discussing pain neuroscience, demonstrating coping strategies, and gently guiding patients through feared activities. Such integration makes this multidimensional approach more accessible, practical, and scalable across diverse clinical settings. Breaking the pain cycle Chronic low back pain isn’t merely a physical issue to be mechanically repaired; it’s deeply influenced by emotional and psychological factors. Critically, this is not to say that chronic pain is “all in the head,” but to dismiss the role of the mind altogether, particularly in our experience and response to pain, is to ignore a vital target for pain treatment . As the biopsychological model posits, an individual’s thoughts, beliefs, and environment can influence the intensity and duration of their pain, and integrating psychological strategies like cognitive-behavioral techniques into physiotherapy may help sustain pain relief over time. Embracing this holistic approach may ultimately help to break the cycle of hope and disappointment that plagues so many suffering from recurring low back pain.

Many are held back by the stigma surrounding sexual health discussions, and the issue is compounded by the common perception that ED is a distressing, though isolated, personal issue with ramifications confined to the bedroom. However, this viewpoint significantly underestimates the broader health implications that ED can signal. Indeed, ED should not be viewed solely as a concern of sexual or reproductive health. In particular, the medical community has long recognized an association between erectile function and cardiovascular (CV) health, which has been supported by decades of research. And yet, despite the strong correlation, there remains a glaring gap in public awareness and understanding of what ED can actually signify about systemic vascular issues and risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). So what’s the link? \\u200b\\u200bMechanisms linking ED and CVD ED and CVD are intricately intertwined, and central to this relationship is the endothelium, a single layer of cells lining our blood vessels. The endothelium is fundamental to vascular health, as it controls the dilation of blood vessels through production of nitric oxide (NO). NO acts as a key signaling agent for blood vessels to relax and expand, thus increasing blood flow, a process critical to both cardiac function and the mechanics of achieving an erection. However, in states like ED and CVD, the production and availability of nitric oxide are often compromised. This is exacerbated by periods of elevated oxidative stress (caused by aging, chronic disease, chronic stress, etc.). When nitric oxide levels are suboptimal, endothelial dysfunction can arise, leading to restricted blood flow and compromised erectile function, as well as kick-starting or worsening the process of atherosclerosis. ED and CVD are also linked in their mutual tendency to be aggravated by chronic low-grade inflammation. Elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers are common to both conditions, fostering further damage to the endothelium and accelerating atherogenesis. This explains in part why ED and CVD share many risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking, and clues us in to why these conditions may co-present so often. And yet, ED does not merely co-occur in many instances with CVD — it frequently precedes overt cardiovascular symptoms due to the smaller diameter of penile arteries compared to coronary arteries. (Indeed, as we’ve often pointed out in the past, cardiovascular disease itself often has no symptoms at all until the occurrence of a potentially fatal event such as a heart attack or stroke.) This implies that ED could often be one of the first signs of systemic vascular disease, acting as an early warning rather than merely a concurrent symptom. Recognizing this temporal relationship shifts the perception of ED from an isolated concern to a significant indicator of endothelial health, accentuating its clinical importance and its potential as an early diagnostic tool for assessing ASCVD risk. (That said, it’s important to note that ED is neither a cause nor a direct consequence of ASCVD, but rather that these represent two distinct manifestations of the same underlying pathology.) How good of an indicator is ED for cardiovascular disease? Just how strong is ED as an indicator of ASCVD? The relationship between the two conditions has been substantiated by a breadth of research, including a landmark study from 2005 that examined data from 9,457 men (aged 55+) who participated in the control arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (conducted from 1994-2003). 1 Individuals with ED or CVD at baseline were excluded, resulting in a final cohort of 4,247 men. Over a nine-year period, these men were assessed for both ED and CVD every three months. Statistical adjustments were made for various confounding variables such as age, body mass index, blood pressure, serum lipids, and lifestyle factors. The findings revealed that 57% of participants (2,420 individuals) developed ED within five years and 65% by the seven-year mark. Adjusted models from the study indicated that incident ED was associated with 25% increased risk for any cardiovascular event (hazard ratio (HR) of 1.25; 95% CI: 1.02–1.53; P =0.04). Among specific CV events, the greatest statistically significant increase in risk was observed for angina (HR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.03–2.28; P =0.04), though associations for strokes and heart attacks neared significance, with HRs of 1.70 (95% CI: 0.98–2.96; P =0.06) and 1.29 (95% CI: 0.96–1.74; P =0.10), respectively. When including participants with baseline ED (doubling the sample size), the risk increases were even greater, especially for transient ischemic attack (stroke-like symptoms that resolve within 24h, caused by short-term reduction in blood flow to the brain), which demonstrated an HR of 1.92 (95% CI, 1.12–3.26; P =0.02). The adjusted HR for any CV event in this larger cohort was 1.45 (95% CI, 1.25–1.69; P <0.001). Ultimately, the risk of a new cardiovascular event was 0.015 per person-year for men without initial ED, compared to 0.024 per person-year among those with initial ED. This means that for every 100 men who had ED at the start of the study, about 2.4 new cardiovascular events would be expected to occur each year. These findings were reinforced by a 2013 meta-analysis of longitudinal studies involving 92,757 participants across an average follow-up of 6.1 years. 2 This study also revealed significant positive associations between ED and risk of cardiovascular events on par with those seen in the 2005 study. Moreover, the authors reported that symptoms of ED typically appeared two to five years before the onset of cardiovascular symptoms, with more severe ED correlating with a greater atherosclerotic burden and increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). These studies underscore ED’s potential as a marker of CV risk, suggesting that it can be utilized in clinical settings as an early warning sign for impending cardiovascular issues. Not only does this broaden the scope of cardiovascular risk assessment, but it also emphasizes the importance of integrating ED evaluation into routine health checks for men, offering a crucial opportunity for early intervention and management of both sexual and cardiovascular health. The impact of management A question naturally follows: can treating ED also prevent or slow ASCVD progression? Emerging evidence suggests that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (e.g., tadalafil, sildenafil) — foundational in the management of ED — may also play a role in mitigating CVD progression. For example, a recent longitudinal study of 509,788 men demonstrated that those who were treated with tadalafil for urogenital issues (including ED) showed a 34% decrease in risk of all-cause mortality, a 27% decrease in risk of heart attack, and a 34% decrease in risk of stroke relative to those who did not take medication. 3 (Benefits were also seen in separate analyses for sildenafil, though the effect was slightly attenuated.) As noted previously, the underlying mechanisms appear to be linked to improvements in endothelial function — a crucial aspect in the genesis of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular complications. Both ED and CV health also often improve with the same lifestyle modifications — such as diet, physical activity, weight management, and smoking cessation — and indeed, such measures are recommended for ED by the American Urological Association. 4 This is supported by evidence that such lifestyle changes can improve endothelial function, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance nitric oxide production, which are critical for both maladies. 5,6 Don’t ignore ED Despite the well-established link between ED and cardiovascular risk, awareness of this connection among the public has been limited. Though authoritative bodies such as the American College of Cardiology point to the need for cardiovascular risk evaluation as an essential component of ED management, clinicians can only utilize ED as an early indicator of CV risk when patients choose to seek medical attention for erectile issues in the first place. Seeking help provides a critical opportunity to detect CVD relatively early and intervene to slow its progression, in addition to offering a chance to improve quality of life and resolve the mental health issues that often accompany ED. So although the clinical community has long recognized the links between ED and CVD, it’s time we rise to the challenge of ensuring that message is heard loud and clear by patients, too: erectile dysfunction is not merely a sexual health concern but is a pivotal canary in the coalmine for overall vascular health — and accordingly, it should be treated with the seriousness and medical attention it deserves.

This points to other possible factors that may contribute to the condition. Research to date has implicated impaired energy metabolism as a potential culprit, as the brain requires enormous amounts of energy to function normally. This, in turn, would suggest that interventions known to boost cellular energy production might offer some relief for those suffering from depression, and attention has turned to one such supplement in particular: creatine. Well known for its role in muscular energetics, might creatine have additional benefits in the treatment of depression? Why creatine? Most conventional antidepressants are based on the “monoamine hypothesis,” which posits that depression results from a depletion of serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine. Many antidepressants, including SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), therefore aim to increase the availability of these neurotransmitters. But in order to produce neurotransmitters and allow them to function properly in driving neural responses, the brain requires energy . The brain is an especially energy-intensive organ, consuming approximately 20% of the body’s energy despite making up only about 2% of body weight. Given this, disruptions in brain energy balance (or, “bioenergetics”) may influence monoamine function, and thus, deficits in brain bioenergetics may underlie or contribute to mood disorders, including depression. 1 Creatine, widely known for its role in muscle energy metabolism, plays a critical role in maintaining brain energy homeostasis. It serves as both an energy buffer — storing cellular energy in the form of high-energy chemical bonds as phosphocreatine — and an energy shuttle, transporting energy produced by mitochondria to areas of high demand within neurons, such as synapses. With creatine’s ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, increases in brain creatine reserves could thus theoretically improve brain bioenergetics and may act synergistically with monoamine-based treatments (like SSRIs). Indeed, growing evidence suggests that combining creatine with SSRIs may improve treatment outcomes. In one proof-of-concept study in women with major depressive disorder, adding 5 g of creatine daily to escitalopram (an SSRI marketed under the brand name Lexapro) led to faster and more substantial symptom relief than escitalopram alone. 2,3 Small, unblinded studies have likewise shown promising reductions in depression scores when other SSRIs and SNRIs were paired with creatine. 4,5 Animal research further underscores this synergy, revealing that blocking serotonin synthesis reduces creatine’s antidepressant-like effects, indicating that the benefits of creatine for depression are at least partially mediated by its effect of enhancing neurotransmitter production and function. 6,7 Human studies, however, have predominantly focused on the combination of creatine with SSRIs, whereas many other antidepressant treatments — both pharmacological and non-pharmacological — are also commonly used by those with major depressive disorder. For instance, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a frontline treatment focused on addressing the negative thought patterns that fuel depression, providing tools to reframe thinking and develop healthier coping strategies. So this leaves us with a key question: does creatine have potential utility as an adjuvant therapy with CBT? A recent study sought to answer this question. 8 An emerging role for creatine with behavioral therapy For this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, authors Sherpa et al. examined 100 participants in India with clinical diagnoses of depression. Participants (mean age 30.4 ±7.4 years, 50% female) were randomized to either CBT plus creatine (5 g/day) or CBT plus placebo for a treatment period of 8 weeks. 8 The CBT protocol for both groups involved a total of five 45-min CBT sessions (one every other week), and the primary outcome — improvement in symptom severity — was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a standard method for evaluating depressive symptoms. Scores on the PHQ-9 can range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating more severe depression (mild depression: scores of 5–9, moderate: 10–14, moderate-severe: 15–19, and severe: ≥20). Results indicated that both groups improved significantly in symptom severity from baseline to the 8-week timepoint. However, the creatine group showed statistically significantly greater improvements, with scores dropping an additional 5.12 points compared to placebo (95% CI: −7.20 to −3.52). Specifically, the CBT-creatine group moved from moderately severe depression (17.8±6.1) to mild depression (5.8±4.8), while the CBT-placebo group remained in the moderate range (shifting from 17.6±6.4 to 11.9±6.6). Additionally, twelve participants in the CBT-creatine group achieved remission (PHQ-9 score <5) compared with five in the CBT-placebo group. While these findings represent the intention-to-treat cohort (i.e., all participants who started treatment, regardless if they completed the entire treatment protocol), dropout rates were high among both groups (around 40%). This certainly may have impacted results, as those who dropped out may have been experiencing less benefit from either treatment. Indeed, the authors also conducted per-protocol analyses (i.e., excluding drop-outs) and reported a slightly greater difference between groups (the mean improvement in the CBT-creatine group exceeded that of the CBT-placebo group by 6.07 points, 95% CI: −7.88 to −4.25). However, an important limitation of this study is that it lacked any comparison to traditional pharmacological antidepressants, and thus, we are restricted in our ability to fully understand the scale of this effect. A difference of five points on the PHQ-9 scale is unequivocally clinically significant, so these new data from Sherpa et al. suggest that creatine can indeed improve outcomes from CBT compared to placebo (though it’s worth noting that the CBT protocol employed here was very light compared to more typical weekly or twice-weekly sessions). Further, according to a meta-analysis including over 50,000 patients, CBT is often just as effective as pharmacological therapies, and individuals who combine medications with CBT fare better than with either treatment alone, 9 but is the combination of creatine and CBT as effective as a combination of SSRIs and CBT? If so, this opens new avenues for patients who do not respond to SSRIs or do not tolerate their side effects to achieve comparable relief as others achieve on traditional medications. Perhaps creatine added to both CBT and antidepressants would show still greater benefit, offering hope to those with the most severe forms of depression. We currently have no direct comparisons to answer these questions, so further clinical studies are warranted. The broader implications The anti-depressive potential of creatine is appealing for several practical reasons. Creatine monohydrate is inexpensive, widely available, and well-studied for safety, with established benefits for muscle function and exercise performance. Its potential role in treating depression adds a layer of accessibility for individuals who are seeking adjuncts to traditional antidepressants. Since many people already use creatine as part of their supplement routine, it could be an easy addition for those looking to improve mental health without major lifestyle changes. It may also serve as a low-cost option for those with limited resources, though evidence to date has only explored the effects of creatine supplementation for depression in combination with another first-line treatment (i.e., CBT and antidepressants). Thus, at present, creatine should not be considered a replacement for standard care. For those wishing to start taking creatine, the most common form used for supplementation is creatine monohydrate powder, typically at a dose of ~5 g/day (also the most common dose in studies on creatine and depression). Mild gastrointestinal upset and water retention (bloating) are among the most commonly reported side effects, but serious complications are rare in healthy adults. Nevertheless, individuals with kidney issues or bipolar disorder should consult a healthcare provider before starting creatine, as they may be at higher risk of adverse effects. The bottom line Creatine’s low risk-to-benefit ratio makes it an intriguing option to consider alongside standard treatments for depression, such as SSRIs or CBT. Already readily available as a muscle-boosting supplement, it may be an easy addition to mental health interventions under proper medical guidance. However, it’s crucial to maintain realistic expectations. While evidence so far is positive, it remains largely preliminary, and what works in small, specialized studies may not hold true for everyone. A central question for future research is whether creatine’s synergistic effect with antidepressants and CBT could become even more robust in a “triple combination” approach, as well as how it might affect other mood and anxiety disorders. As larger, more diverse studies come to light, we’ll gain clearer insights into how creatine might fit into the broader landscape of depression therapies. All in all, creatine offers a potentially valuable tool in the ongoing effort to find more effective, personalized ways to manage depression. Time — and more rigorous research — will tell exactly where it belongs in the therapeutic toolbox.

But in the past few months, the release of the scientific report that will inform new guidelines for 2025-2030 attracted an unusual level of public attention thanks to one particular change from previous editions — namely, the addition of a recommendation to decrease consumption of animal-derived proteins (including meat, poultry, and eggs) in favor of plant-based protein sources like beans, peas, and lentils. 1 What’s changed? This isn’t the first time meat has come under fire with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). Starting in 2015, the guidelines have recommended limiting intake of red and processed meats, and reduced consumption of saturated fats (which are primarily found in animal products such as meats and dairy) has been a part of the DGA since 1980. Past versions of the DGA have also highlighted beans, peas, and lentils as possible sources of plant-based protein, along with nuts, seeds, and soy products. 2 So what makes the new version so different? One key update is in the scope of the DGA’s recommendations for limiting consumption of animal proteins. While previous guidelines have restricted this advice to red and processed meats, the 2025-2030 report recommends cutting back on meat in general (with the exception of seafood), as well as limiting consumption of eggs. This marks a significant deviation from earlier versions, which had supported lean meat options such as chicken breasts and ground turkey. In addition to this expanded denunciation of animal-derived proteins, another important change in the new guidelines relates to the prioritization of beans, peas, and lentils as primary protein sources, rather than as supplemental or alternative options. To this end, the report recommends that beans, peas, and lentils be reassigned from the “vegetable foods group” to the “protein foods group” and that they be listed as first protein options — followed by nuts, seeds, and soy products, then by seafood, and finally by meats, poultry, and eggs as last options. Where did the changes come from? Updates to the DGA don’t come out of nowhere. An advisory committee of nutrition experts is responsible for analyzing up-to-date research in order to form a scientific report that serves as the foundation for any changes to guidelines. The committee tends to be relatively conservative, only adding to or altering previous recommendations when a mountain of evidence seems to support the change (for example, the committee did not introduce the recommendation to reduce consumption of added sugars until its 2015-2020 revision 3 ). So how strong is the evidence that motivated the new recommendation against meat consumption? At a surface level, it might seem fairly compelling. Many observational studies — often with impressively large cohort sizes — have reported correlations between animal protein consumption and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, and a host of other maladies. Likewise, several studies have reported inverse associations between adherence to a plant-based diet and risk of mortality or various health problems. A closer look However, once we dig a little deeper, this body of “evidence” starts to fall apart as quickly as a house of cards. We’ve discussed the many shortcomings of studies on plant and animal protein — and why they fail to show what they claim to show — ad nauseam over the years (see here , here , and here as just a few examples). But as a brief recap, a fundamental problem with the vast majority of evidence condemning animal protein is that it derives from observational data that are rife with confounds related to the overall health of participants . Health is one of the top motivations for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet in the United States, 4 and it is highly likely that an individual who cares about their health enough to commit to this sort of dietary restriction likewise cares about their health enough to engage in other health-promoting behaviors like exercise, prioritization of sleep, and avoidance of smoking. By contrast, many people who eat a lot of meat do so despite popular perception (however misguided) that it is detrimental to health, and we can assume these individuals are more likely to similarly ignore other health advice. Thus, a pattern emerges: people who eat less meat are, on average, healthier than people who eat more meat for reasons other than their dietary habits, and therefore, people who eat less meat are less likely to develop or die from chronic health conditions independently of their decision to eschew animal proteins. This pattern shows up in observational data as a correlation between meat consumption and disease, though the true causal relationship is with other dietary and non-dietary variables. Of note, a few randomized trials (which avoid the confounds that plague observational studies) have reported health benefits of cutting meat out of participants’ diets. However, many of these come with their own considerable flaws , such as discrepancies in total calorie intake between groups. Indeed, several overarching systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials on this subject have reported no negative impact of meat consumption (or positive impact of avoiding meat consumption) on risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, or other conditions commonly associated with meat-heavy diets. 5,6 Optimizing public versus personal health Does all of the above mean that the advisory committee got it wrong in their recommendations for updates to the DGA? That depends on how you interpret the purpose for dietary guidelines in the first place. Federal guidelines on nutrition are intended to promote health and fitness at the national population level, largely as a means of reducing the burden on the healthcare system. The best way to accomplish this goal is to raise the health of those on the lower end of the population’s health spectrum, as these are the individuals who have the greatest room for improvement by relatively simple measures and are also those who would otherwise incur the vast majority of medical costs. And for individuals who lack the time or interest for gaining a detailed understanding of nutrition’s effects on health, a short set of simple, clear guidelines — such as “replace meat with beans and peas” — has a better chance of making an impact than an exhaustive description of nuances and exceptions — such as “limit highly processed foods, including processed meats, and avoid getting your meat from fast food joints, where you’re more likely to pair meat with empty calories from fries or soda…. Also, prioritize lean meat sources with high amounts of essential amino acids, but be careful about how you prepare it so you’re not loading up on additional fats and salt, and make sure that in addition to meat, you’re getting plenty of vegetables and fiber.” Thus, when it comes to the goal of optimizing public health, the present updates to past dietary guidelines make sense. But these updates become problematic if we interpret them as advice for optimizing personal health. For those who already pay a fair amount of attention to their health, such reductive guidelines can be counterproductive. For instance, although animal-derived protein tends to be higher quality and more bioavailable than plant-based proteins, the new guidelines might steer people away from the former, leading to insufficient intake of essential amino acids to support building and maintaining muscle mass. In other words, the DGA are meant to help those at more imminent risk of nutrition-related health problems, not to help any given individual attain maximal possible health. (Think of them like a walker or cane — great for improving mobility among the elderly or injured, but if used by an Olympic sprinter during a race, it will probably do more harm than good.) The bottom line Federal dietary guidelines serve a valuable purpose for public health in providing steps for avoiding both nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excess. Their simplicity makes them accessible and actionable for anyone — from elementary school students learning about food groups to adults without the time, money, education, or energy to undertake their own deep dive into nutrition research. They are a practical approach for improving the average health of the nation and reducing strain on the healthcare system, but they have never been intended to serve as a means of achieving maximal health for the individual . This is the lens through which we must view the recent addition of a recommendation to limit all meat, poultry, and eggs and prioritize beans, peas, and lentils as protein sources. The advice has been broadcast at face value by news outlets as validation of the notion that meat is unambiguously bad for health, but in truth, this guideline is merely a way of promoting an all-around healthier diet through factors correlated with meat consumption — for instance, overconsumption of saturated fats and processed foods and underconsumption of fiber and plant-derived vitamins and minerals. Such a simplistic guideline is expedient, but it can also be misleading for those who are already attentive to diet quality and other aspects of a healthy lifestyle. Human physiology (and the role of nutrition in affecting it) is extraordinarily complex and cannot be reduced to the few general statements of the DGA. Optimizing personal health requires a far more nuanced and sophisticated approach that takes into account the many dietary variables at play and the circumstances and preferences of the individual. So five years down the road, when the USDA rolls out the next set of updates to the DGA, let’s all take them with a few grains of salt… and perhaps with a nice chicken sandwich or omelet, too.

Nevertheless, as long as we remain aware of their shortcomings, such studies can serve the purpose of generating new hypotheses or providing results which might corroborate (not prove ) existing theories regarding the relationships between two variables. Such is the cautious mindset we must adopt in considering a recent paper by Cavaillès et al. 1 on the relationship between poor sleep and brain aging. Although many methodological flaws limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the study itself, the work serves as a timely reminder (this past week was the National Sleep Foundation’s annual “Sleep Awareness Week,” after all) of the much larger body of evidence supporting the critical role of sleep in cognitive health. About the study The authors of this observational study used data from 589 participants (mean age: 40.4±3.4 years at baseline) in the long-term CARDIA study of cardiovascular disease who had filled out a baseline sleep quality questionnaire in 2000-01 (566 of whom had also filled out a second sleep questionnaire in 2005-06). The questionnaires asked participants about six of what the authors termed “poor sleep characteristics” (PSCs), which included factors like daytime sleepiness, early morning awakening, and difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. Each questionnaire was then assigned a score of 0-6 depending on how many of these PSCs were present. As part of the CARDIA protocol, all subjects underwent a brain MRI scan 15 years after the initial sleep questionnaire, after which the authors used the Spatial Pattern of Atrophy for Recognition of Brain Aging (SPARE-BA) method to determine “brain age” for each subject. The SPARE-BA method uses algorithms involving structural brain characteristics to quantify differences in age-related atrophy. The higher the value determined by the SPARE-BA method, the more age-related atrophy is present, and thus, the “older” the brain (or so the logic goes). The authors found that MRI-determined brain age increased in subjects with PSCs in a dose-response manner. Compared to the group with 0-1 PSCs, subjects with 2-3 PSCs reportedly had a brain age that was 1.9 years older (95% CI: 0.55–3.18), while subjects with greater than 3 PSCs had a brain age that was 3.5 years older (95% CI: 1.53–5.56). They also found that difficulty initiating sleep and early morning awakening were both specifically associated with the greatest increases in brain age relative to not having those specific PSCs. Again, this study is observational, so the observed correlations do not provide evidence of causation. To make matters worse, sleep quality was measured by questionnaires, which are subject to response bias and other sources of error associated with self-reporting – not to mention that they assume sleep habits aren’t subject to substantial changes over time. And finally, it’s unclear how well MRI data and the SPARE-BA method were truly capable of accurately predicting “brain age” or potential cognitive consequences. It’s doubtful whether a difference in MRI-determined brain age of 1.8 years is actually meaningful or would correspond to clinically noticeable differences in an individual’s cognitive function or future cognitive trajectory. (The authors did not have data on cognitive function among the MRI subjects.) Indeed, it seems there is no end to the shortcomings of this study, so why even bother discussing it? The bigger picture The methodological problems should make us extremely skeptical of the study’s results (we certainly can’t conclude, for instance, that the tendency to wake early in the morning at your present age will cause your brain to be 3.8 years older than it otherwise would have been 15 years from now). And yet, as is true for virtually all attempts to ascertain long-term health consequences of chronic lifestyle habits, investigating the impact of sleep on brain health over the course of decades is extremely challenging, so we have to consider how the entire body of evidence fits together. A definitive evaluation of the relationship between sleep and brain health in a long-term randomized trial isn’t possible for numerous ethical and logistical reasons. So instead, we must take the many imperfect pieces that exist – i.e., from animal studies, short-term RCTs, and yes, epidemiology – and try to build as complete a picture as possible. Cavaillès et al. ’s work may add little to the existing body of knowledge on sleep, brain aging, and cognitive health, but the correlations they report nevertheless align with clues we’ve obtained from more rigorous investigations. For instance, mechanistic experiments have shown that loss of sleep triggers an increase in neuroinflammation and impairment of the glymphatic system (the brain’s “sewage system”), which in turn have been linked to neurodegenerative disease. 2 Even a single night of sleep deprivation has been found to increase levels of amyloid-beta, a protein implicated in Alzheimer’s disease pathology, 3 as well as altering learning-related neural connectivity. 4 I discuss this evidence in greater detail in my three – part series with sleep expert Matthew Walker on The Drive , but collectively, findings to date strongly support the importance of sleep as a preventative measure against dementia, to support learning and memory, and to promote mental health, among countless other benefits. Thus, at the very least, the study by Cavaillès et al. helps to draw fresh attention to a conclusion better made by previous work: sleep is vital for brain health. The bottom line Scientific literature must always be evaluated with a critical and unbiased eye, whether it supports our pre-existing beliefs or not, and this recent study on sleep and brain health is no exception. From flawed methods for acquiring sleep data to unvalidated methods for assessing brain age, the many problems with this study prevent us from drawing reliable conclusions from it. However, the value of this work can perhaps be found in how it fits within the larger pool of knowledge generated to date on the effect of sleep on long-term brain health. Given the logistical difficulty of directly examining this subject, we must look to that body of evidence as a whole (which includes several far more rigorous investigations than observational study discussed here). In taking that wider view, we can see more clearly that sufficient, high-quality sleep is one of the most important “interventions” we can make for our cognitive health.

If true, this connection between body weight and autoimmunity would further compound public health crises related to obesity, but although past observational studies hinted at a connection, the critical question has remained unanswered: does obesity cause these conditions, or is it merely a bystander? A recent study sought to address this gap, with the hope that improving our understanding of the relationship between obesity and autoimmune disease might provide new approaches to prevention or treatment of the latter. Inferring causality from observational data Observational studies can only show correlations and cannot establish causality, in large part because of the potential for confounding variables. Obesity, for instance, is associated with numerous other variables — such as diet quality, metabolic health, exercise habits, and even age — which may independently impact risk of autoimmune disease, making it impossible to isolate the effects of obesity per se . While randomized controlled trials are a classic solution to the problem of confounds (as known and unknown confounding factors should be evenly distributed between the groups when group assignments are random), such trials would be impractical and unethical for assessing the effects of obesity, given the many known health risks of excess body weight. Thus, to investigate the question of causality in the obesity/autoimmunity relationship, authors Li et al. employed a technique commonly used for simulating a randomized trial in an observational study: Mendelian randomization (MR). Longtime readers will likely be familiar with MR from previous newsletters , but as a brief refresher, this methodology uses gene variants that are predictive of a specific exposure (in this case, increased body weight) as a proxy for the exposure itself. Because gene variants are randomly assigned at conception (that is, they are not influenced by the individual’s lifestyle or environment), using these variants simulates randomization and eliminates the influence of the many confounding variables associated with obesity itself. About the study The investigators analyzed genetic data from over 550,000 individuals from the UK Biobank and the FinnGen study for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA that are known to predict various obesity metrics. 1 Specifically, the authors used 68 SNPs that were predictive of body mass index (BMI), 52 that were predictive of hip circumference, 41 for waist circumference, and 29 for waist-to-hip ratio. They then investigated the associations between these SNPs and 15 autoimmune diseases, including asthma, celiac disease, and type 1 diabetes, among others. Looking at one of the metrics, BMI, Li et al. found that for each point increase in BMI (or more precisely, a unit increase in the genetically predicted BMI), the risk of several autoimmune conditions increased significantly. The data showed a 28% increased risk for asthma (odds ratio (OR): 1.28; 95% CI: 1.18-1.09; P <0.001), 37% for hypothyroidism (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.24-1.51; P <0.001), 52% for psoriasis (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.27-1.83; P <0.001), 22% for rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.06-1.40; P =0.005), and a 55% increase in risk for type 1 diabetes (OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.32-1.83; P <0.001). As expected for a pseudo-randomized study, nearly all of these associations remained robust even after accounting for potential confounding factors like smoking and drinking behaviors. The single exception was rheumatoid arthritis, which lost statistical significance after adjustment (though significance had only been borderline in the unadjusted model). Results were generally similar for the other obesity metrics tested, though associations were somewhat stronger for waist circumference and weaker for waist-to-hip ratio. Some less common autoimmune conditions had limited data available, meaning we may not yet understand the full scope of obesity’s impact on autoimmune disease. Additionally, the data used for this study came from people of European descent (for whom we have the most information regarding associations between SNPs and health implications), meaning the study’s findings are primarily applicable to this population, and further research is needed to confirm any relationships in other ethnic groups. Regardless, the data presented provide a compelling case for a causal link between excess weight and several autoimmune conditions. How does fat drive autoimmunity? Why might obesity trigger autoimmune conditions? To understand this, we need to think about the effects of excess adiposity on inflammation. The accumulation of fat tends to fuel systemic inflammation by triggering the release of pro-inflammatory molecules (including IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, and IFN-γ), but not all fat contributes equally to this inflammatory state. Unlike subcutaneous fat, visceral and ectopic fat (fat that accumulates around and within internal organs) are particularly strong drivers of chronic inflammation, which in turn can overwhelm the body’s regulatory mechanisms and potentially lead to autoimmune responses (for more on addressing chronic inflammation, see AMA #59 ). But how much fat does it take to drive inflammation and autoimmunity? Unfortunately, there is no single threshold that applies to everyone. As discussed in greater depth in a premium article on body composition , individuals vary in their capacity for “normal” fat storage in subcutaneous depots, and once this capacity is exceeded, fat begins to accumulate in the viscera, triggering greater systemic inflammation. Though the exact level of fat required to reach this “spillover” point may differ across individuals, everyone will eventually reach their personal threshold if fat accumulation continues. I often use a bathtub analogy to explain this concept. Imagine subcutaneous fat as the place your body was designed to store excess energy safely — like water in a bathtub. Some people have a large tub, while others have a smaller one (determined in part by genetics), but if water flowing in (i.e., the calories you’re consuming) consistently exceeds the water draining out (i.e., the calories you’re expending), the tub eventually overflows. The implication from these mechanistic insights is that visceral fat — rather than BMI per se — drives the association between obesity and autoimmunity. Indeed, this conclusion would be supported by Li et al. ’s data showing generally stronger positive associations with autoimmune conditions for genetic variants associated with waist circumference — a rough indicator of visceral fat — than with genetic variants for BMI itself. However, because everyone has an [unknown] upper limit to their capacity to store fat subcutaneously, the probability of exceeding that limit increases for everyone as total fat mass increases. Thus, the best strategy for avoiding autoimmunity caused by excess visceral fat is to keep total fat mass in check. The bottom line The link between obesity and disease is not new, but this study reinforces just how far-reaching the consequences of excess adiposity can be. It provides causal evidence that obesity may directly increase the risk of autoimmune conditions, adding to the long list of reasons to prioritize metabolic health. The message is clear: addressing obesity isn’t just about aesthetics or even traditional obesity-associated health concerns like cardiovascular disease or diabetes. It’s about preventing a cascade of potential health consequences that can significantly impact the length and quality of life, and autoimmune conditions are another addition to this list. With the extensive impacts of excess fat accumulation, avoiding it by maintaining energy balance is a critical element of any plan for preventing chronic disease.

Metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), are each independently associated with elevated risk of numerous other deadly conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. But metabolic disorders are also highly interconnected, with 50-70% of patients with NAFLD also presenting with T2D. 1 Given the health implications of these conditions and the frequency with which they co-occur, interest is growing in whether various metabolic derangements might interact in their effects on promoting other diseases. Indeed, a study by Kim et al. recently explored the effects of concurrent T2D and NAFLD on cardiovascular risk relative to each of these conditions in isolation, offering timely insights on a critical question for health in the developed world. What they did The investigators analyzed data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, a single-payer system covering more than 97% of the Korean population. 2 This comprehensive dataset allowed investigators to examine nearly 7.8 million participants (mean age: 45.9±13.7) over a median follow-up of 8.13 years to assess associations between T2D, NAFLD, and the incidence of heart attacks, ischemic strokes, and all-cause mortality. Participants were grouped based on T2D status (defined as fasting glucose >126 mg/dL or use of antidiabetic medication) and NAFLD severity, which was calculated using a fatty liver index incorporating triglycerides, γ-glutamyl transferase, BMI, and waist circumference. NAFLD was categorized as grade 1 (fatty liver index between 30 and 60) or grade 2 (index >60). Individuals with existing cardiovascular disease at baseline or a history of cardiac events within one year of follow-up were excluded from the analysis. Cardiovascular risk with metabolic disease Among patients with T2D, the majority also had some degree of fatty liver disease (60.79% vs. 31.22% in non-diabetics), confirming a high co-occurrence of T2D and NAFLD as expected. Also as expected, healthy control participants (those with neither T2D nor NAFLD) demonstrated a lower five-year absolute risk of a cardiovascular event than participants with either T2D or NAFLD, with healthy controls showing a five-year absolute risk of 1.03% (95% CI: 1.02-1.04%) compared to a 3.34% (95% CI: 3.27-3.41%) risk for T2D alone and 1.42% (95% CI: 1.40-1.45%) risk for grade 2 (severe) NAFLD alone. But among participants with both T2D and severe NAFLD, the five-year risk of a cardiovascular event was 4.66% (95% CI: 4.54-4.78%), meaning that someone with both conditions has about a 1-in-20 chance of developing CVD in the next five years. These results thus demonstrate that the risk of a cardiac event with both conditions was higher than with either condition alone . Data on all-cause mortality risk were even more dramatic, as diabetic patients with severe fatty liver disease showed a 5.91% (95% CI: 5.78-6.05%) five-year mortality rate. This risk level was nearly five times higher than healthy controls , who showed a risk of 1.25% (95% CI: 1.24-1.26%). A multiplicative effect These findings might seem obvious — having two risk factors is associated with greater risk than having only one. But upon closer examination, we see that the increased risk associated with both conditions is not merely additive , but rather multiplicative . That is, while severe NAFLD alone increased absolute risk of cardiovascular events by 0.42% and T2D alone by 2.34%, the combination increased risk by 3.63% — roughly 36% higher than the 2.66% expected from simple addition of the risks associated with each condition in isolation. This indicates that T2D and NAFLD have synergistic effects on raising risk of cardiovascular events, a pattern that was also observed even in the context of mild fatty liver disease (grade 1 NAFLD). Grade 1 NAFLD increased cardiac risk to the tune of 1.23% (95% CI: 1.22-1.25%) for non-diabetics but 3.94% (95% CI: 3.87-4.02%) for those with T2D — again, a multiplicative, rather than additive, relationship. Of note, five-year absolute risk also increased exponentially with age. The synergistic effect held true for mortality as well. T2D alone held a 3.68% risk (95% CI: 3.61-3.74%; a 2.43% increase over controls), while severe fatty liver disease alone held a 2.09% risk (95% CI: 2.06-2.12%; a 0.84% increase from controls). If you were to simply add the individual increases in risk from each disease together, this would leave us with a total increase in risk of 3.27%, but recall that the actual risk among participants with both conditions was 5.91% – a 4.66% higher risk than controls. These findings align with our understanding of metabolic disease as a systemic condition with complex interconnections. While this was an observational study limited to the Korean population, it certainly wouldn’t be surprising, given our current understanding of the underlying biology, if these patterns were found to translate to other demographics. The multiplicative effect observed here supports the concept that metabolic dysfunction represents a foundation for several major chronic diseases, with each condition potentially worsening others through various feedback mechanisms. This study adds quantitative evidence to further support what we’ve long suspected: the whole of metabolic health is greater than the sum of its parts. Why this matters for you If you’re living with or at risk for type 2 diabetes or fatty liver disease, this study reinforces the importance of addressing these conditions early and comprehensively. They aren’t isolated problems but systemic issues that are deeply connected , sharing root causes like insulin resistance and inflammation. Further, this study underscores that even mild fatty liver disease can substantially raise cardiovascular risk, especially when paired with T2D. For those without these conditions, the findings serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of prevention. Lifestyle interventions — such as weight management, regular exercise, proper sleep, and blood glucose control (see more in AMA #51 on metabolic health) — can target the underlying drivers of metabolic disease and significantly reduce risk of developing these conditions. By taking action now, you can not only improve your overall metabolic health, but also prevent the onslaught of other health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease. In metabolic disease, the adverse health effects of one metabolic condition appear to amplify those of another, creating a compounding risk that exceeds the sum of their individual impacts. But here’s the good news: the same strategies that help to avoid one condition usually help to avoid others as well. By addressing these conditions early with lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, we have the potential to prevent not just one disease, but a cascade of multiplicative health risks.

CGRP and RAMP1 have long been recognized as having key roles in migraines, and because migraines are a common comorbidity of endometriosis, the authors hypothesized that this signaling pathway might mediate the pain associated with both conditions. Therefore, they sought to characterize CGRP’s involvement in endometriosis in the hope that existing anti-CGRP migraine drugs might perhaps prove useful in treating endometriosis as well. 4 After first confirming that CGRP-positive nerve fibers were present in both human endometriosis lesions and lesions from a mouse model of endometriosis, the investigators found that selectively killing these pain-sensing CGRP fibers in mice significantly reduced pain. Specifically, they showed that animals in which CGRP fibers had been destroyed demonstrated reduced sensitivity to painful stimuli relative to control animals with intact nerve fibers, with controls responding to forces nearly four times lower (0.1 grams vs. 0.4 grams) than the experimental group. This suggests that the CGRP-containing nerve fibers are responsible for the pain in this mouse model of endometriosis. Indeed, killing these nerve fibers not only lessened painful symptoms in the mice, it also reduced the size of the endometriosis lesions, a key indicator of disease progression. While the total number of lesions was not affected, ablation reduced lesion size by about one-third (from ~0.6 mm to ~0.2 mm). As such, targeting the CGRP-containing nerves may help not only with pain management but also with stemming progression of the disease itself. Of course, killing an entire class of nerve fibers is a much more dramatic intervention than existing medications targeting CGRP signaling, so to better assess whether results might translate to therapies for human use, Fattori et al. also evaluated the effects of approved anti-CGRP migraine drugs on pain in mice. Specifically, they tested two antibody-based drugs targeting the CGRP receptor (fremanezumab and galcanezumab) and two drugs that act as receptor antagonists (rimegepant, and ubrogepant), and they found that the medications yielded similar benefits as nerve ablation. For instance, rimegepant showed dose-dependent reductions in both spontaneous pain (watching the animal to see if they displayed pain-related behaviors) and evoked pain (applying calibrated forces to determine how sensitive the animals are), along with decreased lesion size. Taken together, this study tells us that CGRP nerve fibers are present in endometriosis lesions and mediate pain associated with the disease as well as disease progression. Further, these experiments show that pharmaceuticals targeting this mechanism offer a promising strategy for treatment. Why this matters The idea that CGRP may play a role in endometriosis is not completely new, but the work by Fattori et al. provides the first clear evidence that CGRP-targeting migraine drugs may help in disease treatment. This would offer a non-hormonal, non-opioid treatment option for patients who cannot tolerate or don’t respond to current therapies. Additionally, these drugs appear to provide dual benefits – addressing both pain relief and disease progression. Still, these tests were all conducted in mouse models of endometriosis, so is optimism for humans premature? We know that animal studies are useful for understanding the mechanism behind disease and serve an important role in assessing safety early in the drug development process. However, when most drugs undergo these preliminary animal tests, clinical utility of the results for humans is still years or even decades away. The vast majority of drugs showing success in animals never make it to market at all and die in early phases of clinical trials. So why are we bothering to report on Fattori et al. ’s results if the road ahead is so long and carries such a high risk of disappointment? The answer lies in a handy shortcut known as drug repurposing . Drug repurposing, or using existing approved medications for new conditions, can dramatically accelerate the path to treatment for patients. Since these medications have already passed safety trials, have already received FDA approval for migraine indications, and are already on the market, they could move much more quickly through clinical trials for the new indication of endometriosis than a completely novel drug. As one example, rimegepant has a well-known safety profile, with the most commonly reported side effect being nausea (2.7% vs. 0.8% with placebo), according to the manufacturer site. 5 Yet although prior FDA approval for migraine treatment sidesteps the need for trials demonstrating safety , it’s important to note that it does not diminish the need for evidence demonstrating efficacy for endometriosis (at least in order to receive FDA approval for this indication, though any drug that has approval for one condition might technically be prescribed off-label for others). Fattori et al. ’s results are promising, but mouse models don’t always translate perfectly to human disease. Still, with the safety of these medications already known, the amount of preclinical and early-stage clinical evidence needed to move forward with larger human efficacy studies is lower than if the drugs were newly developed. This suggests that a viable human treatment for those suffering from endometriosis may be relatively close, rather than a decade away with marginal chance of success. The road ahead This study highlights the value of mechanistic research in identifying new applications for existing drugs – potentially offering shorter paths to relief for patients with difficult-to-treat conditions. For the millions suffering from endometriosis, particularly those who have exhausted current treatment options, this research offers hope for faster access to a potentially effective new(ish) therapy. While we await clinical trials, physicians might consider these medications for off-label use in patients who have failed conventional treatments. But Fattori et al. ’s data have caught a substantial amount of attention in the scientific and medical community, so with any luck, human data won’t be far behind.

The investigators pooled data from 19 studies that used exercise alone (i.e., not in conjunction with other sleep interventions) in a total of 1,233 participants who did not have other sleep-related disorders. Included studies varied in duration between four weeks and 12 months. The effect of exercise was compared to inactive controls for four objective sleep metrics measured via polysomnography and actigraphy: total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL, the amount of time it takes to fall asleep), wake after sleep onset (WASO, the total time awake during the night after falling asleep), and sleep efficiency (SEI, the ratio of TST to total time in bed). Additionally, the researchers used data from sleep questionnaires to assess three subjective sleep metrics: subjective TST (i.e., the participant’s perception of their total sleep time), subjective SOL (the participant’s perception of their sleep onset latency), and sleep quality (SQ, how rested participants felt upon waking and their overall satisfaction with sleep). What they found Despite the significant heterogeneity across study interventions, exercise interventions had a small but significant positive effect on objective sleep parameters, as indicated by a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.37 (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.57). (For a detailed explanation of SMD, see this newsletter , but in brief, this is a summary statistic to assess the magnitude of a given effect in pooled data, with values between 0.2–0.5 indicating a small effect, values between 0.5–0.8 indicating a moderate effect, and values over 0.8 indicating a large effect.) The impact of exercise on objective sleep parameters collectively was driven by improvements in WASO (SMD=0.50; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.86) and SEI (SMD=0.66; 95% CI: 0.27 to 1.06). However, exercise did not improve TST or SOL, meaning that subjects did not fall asleep faster and did not get more total sleep, though they were awake less throughout the night and spent more of their total time in bed asleep. Exercise interventions also had a significant, large effect on subjective sleep parameters collectively (SMD=0.90; 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.19), though these metrics are more susceptible to bias than objective measures. The strongest effect was observed with subjective sleep quality (SMD=1.16; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.61), though subjective TST (SMD=0.69; 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.05), and subjective SOL (SMD=0.48; 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.75) also exhibited significant improvements. This indicates that participants felt like they fell asleep faster, slept longer, and were more rested and satisfied with their sleep, even if these sentiments did not align in all cases with objective measurements. Of note, the magnitude of improvement in sleep parameters from exercise interventions was greater with higher exercise intensity (though intensities for all included studies were considered light to low-moderate) and in studies with higher average participant age or a higher proportion of females. Insomnia can be due to age-related decreases in physical fitness, at least partially explaining why exercise intervention may be greater for older individuals. The greater effect in women could likewise be explained by lower average physical fitness in females due to historically lower rates of exercising, and potentially to worse sleep at baseline from hormone-related (i.e., menopausal) deficits in sleep quality. Study limitations It’s not a stretch to conclude that exercise is good for sleep, but efforts to derive more nuanced insights from this analysis are limited by the studies included within it. Criteria for chronic insomnia varied across studies, indicating different levels of severity for insomnia diagnoses, which could affect the magnitude of the effect from an exercise intervention. Similarly, nine of the included studies did not include information about the use of sleep aids, which also could impact the effects of an exercise intervention (either positively or negatively). However, the biggest limitation of this study is the intensity range of the exercise interventions. The controls (no exercise intervention) were assigned an intensity of 0 metabolic equivalents (METs), and the exercise interventions had intensities of 1-4 METs (most studies used 3 METs). This is not how METs are typically represented. Usually, one MET is the amount of oxygen consumed while at rest, so this analysis included exercise interventions of 2-5 METs, oversampling the light end of the intensity spectrum. It’s difficult to call an intensity of 2 METs exercising, as this is the energy required to put away laundry or eat while standing. An intensity of 3 METs would be achieved by walking on a treadmill at 2.0 to 2.4 mph at a 0% grade, while 4 METs corresponds to leisurely cycling at a speed of <10 mph, and 5 METs is the intensity from shooting baskets or kayaking at a moderate pace. Since the majority of included studies were at an intensity of 4 METs, there is limited ability to determine the dose-response effect of exercise intensity on sleep parameters, since sleep parameters very likely improve when the exercise intervention ramps up to an intensity higher than what was tested in the included studies. The limited intensity range also means that we don’t know whether an individual who is very active at baseline might see improvements in sleep by adding more exercise to their routine, though it certainly seems likely that ceasing all exercise would make insomnia worse. The significant heterogeneity between interventions (type of exercise, frequency, duration) makes it impossible to give a specific exercise “prescription” for insomnia. Although exercise may be the last thing on your mind if it’s been a while since your last good night of sleep, the significant improvements in sleep quality at the low range of exercise intensity tell us that if you are not exercising, adding any form of physical activity is likely to improve your sleep. And even if you start at very low intensity, increasing exercise intensity over time may lead to further sleep improvements. The bottom line After a night (or week, or month) of poor sleep, exercise is often the last thing we want to do. Yet although daytime grogginess and fatigue from inadequate or low-quality sleep might seem like reasonable reasons to deprioritize your fitness routine, remaining sedentary can feed the vicious cycle of fatigue and poor sleep. Exercise, by contrast, has been shown to significantly improve sleep quality in people with insomnia. Although more research is needed to determine how exercise and other interventions (particularly CBT-I) might complement each other, exercise on its own is a cost-effective, accessible intervention to improve both objective and subjective measures of sleep.

However, the whole point of living longer becomes inconsequential if you are not physically and mentally fit enough to enjoy the final decade of your life – what I refer to as your “marginal decade.” What constitutes enjoyment in these years will be unique to each one of us; it could mean being healthy enough to continue world travel, or simply being able to get up and down from the floor to play with the young children in your life. This week, we’re spotlighting several exceptional people in their 80s, 90s, and beyond who inspire us by showing what is possible in these later decades of life. The late-in-life marathoner In December 2022, Mathea Allansmith became the oldest woman to complete a marathon at the age of 92 years and 194 days. She finished the Honolulu Marathon in 11 hours, 19 minutes, and 49 seconds. While that feat alone is impressive, it is all the more so when we learn that running was not a lifelong passion for Allansmith. The now-retired ophthalmologist began running at the age of 46, building up from running two miles daily to running in the Boston Marathon six years later in 1982. Allansmith credits her longevity in the sport to a few universal principles : find the physical activity you enjoy and be consistent in doing it, eat nutritious foods, and take life one day (or sometimes one step) at a time. The adventurer Not unlike running a marathon, climbing the tallest mountains in the world requires both physical and mental stamina. In 2003, Yuichiro Miura became the oldest person to climb Mount Everest at age 70, but he hardly rested on his laurels. Miura proceeded to break his own record for the feat twice – first in 2008 at age 75, and finally on May 23, 2013 at 80 years and 223 days old, the world record that stands today. At the time of his 2013 summit, Miura expressed the goal of climbing Everest again at age 90, which would have been in 2023, though subsequent illness and development of a lingering numbness in his limbs has prevented him from doing so. Even still, these concerns did not keep him grounded altogether. At 90 years of age, he reached the summit of Mt Fuji , the tallest peak in Japan, facilitated by a support team and a special wheelchair meant for mountain climbing. Even though Miura has made it to the mountaintop many times, he still expresses awe at the experience and the beauty of the view. The legend The longest-standing active rider of the Motor Maids , a North American women’s motorcycle club, is a legend in the world of motorcycling. Gloria Tramontin Struck’s family was in the business of selling motorcycles, but it was only by her brother’s insistence that she learned to ride at the age of 16, a skill that she found could facilitate her love of travel. As you can imagine, in 1941 there was quite a stigma for female motorcyclists, but she persevered and has now ridden more than 700,000 miles in her 83 years of riding, including riding in the Alps at age 75. Tramontin turned 99 this past July and isn’t slowing down just yet. She’s hoping to do another cross-country ride from New Jersey to California next year for her 100th birthday. The 90-year-old astronaut On May 19, 2024, Ed Dwight became the oldest person to fly in space at the age of 90 years, 8 months, and 10 days. Dwight, a US Air Force captain who had been the first African American in the Aerospace Research Pilot School for astronaut training, had never been selected for a space flight in the 1960s. After retiring from the Air Force, Ed became a well-known artist and sculptor , and it seemed as though the dream of going to space would remain just that – a dream. However, the aerospace manufacturer Blue Origin offered Dwight the chance to make that dream come true in the form of a short, sub-orbital flight to the edge of space before returning to Earth. When reflecting on the experience, Ed said, “I thought I didn’t need this in my life, but I lied. I really did need it.” This just goes to show that opportunities can come along at any age – we just have to be ready for them when they arrive. The surf Betty Several months ago, I came across this video of Nancy Meherne from New Zealand, a surfer who sums up her approach to life as “You gotta have fun!” – and her joie de vivre is infectious. Nancy may not be setting world records, but she is nevertheless a very impressive lady who proves that living your best marginal decade is all about maintaining the capacity to engage in the activities that bring you happiness. For Meherne, that meant growing “just about every kind of vegetable that she can eat,” teaching music, riding her bike, dancing to the radio, and getting out to surf at age 91. How many people do you know in their 90s who could independently carry a surfboard, walk on a sandy beach, and get in the water (not to mention getting into and out of a wetsuit, which on its own requires a fair amount of mobility)? Sadly, Nancy passed at age 93 in the summer of 2022, but she remains an inspiration as someone who lived exceptionally well up until the last days of her life, remaining active and delighting in the joys of daily life. The bottom line Hopefully, it is abundantly clear that traveling to space or running a marathon is in no way required to have your best marginal decade. All of these inspiring individuals are living extraordinary lives in older age by staying active, having goals, connecting with nature, eating healthfully, and continuing to challenge themselves – concepts that everyone can implement. While it is impossible to know exactly when your marginal decade will begin, imagining what your ideal life might look like at any age can be motivating to start building the foundation for that life today.

This year, we’ve also decided to do a special end-of-year newsletter in which we use specific examples from the past year’s worth of podcast episodes to illustrate how to apply James’s insights across a variety of health and wellness areas. The four steps to developing a habit Your health goals are probably easy to articulate, but your “system” – the collection of habits that you regularly follow — is what will ultimately determine whether you reach them. As James explained on the podcast, a large amount of our behavior (40-50%) is automatic and habitual, and we are building habits all the time whether we are consciously aware of it or not. Forming good habits is an essential part of both my clinical practice and my approach to my own health and life. While our ultimate goal is to change behaviors, we have to start with forming habits. A series of small and easy changes can collectively make a very big difference. The key to James’s advice is to follow four “laws” to incorporate an action into your routine so that it becomes a habit: 1) Make it obvious; 2) Make it attractive; 3) Make it easy; and 4) Make it satisfying. Figure 1. Four Laws of Behavior Change for Developing Good Habits. Credit: radreads.co In this newsletter, we’re going to go through each of these elements and apply them to some of the actionable health advice we received from guests on The Drive over the past year. 1. Make it obvious Cues promoting a good habit should be easy to spot and grab one’s attention. For example, if you want to run each morning, put your running shoes by the door as a visual reminder. Of course, this step requires you to first identify such potential cues. Ask yourself what visual reminders would help you and where in your home, office, car, or anywhere else they should be. As an example, consider our episode on foot health with Courtney Conley , who emphasized that we lose strength in our feet as we age, which can lead to instability and injury. As we discussed in that episode, toe spacers can help to enhance foot proprioception and toe strength, so for those who want to develop the habit of wearing toe spacers, a great first step would be to keep them in obvious places. Put a pair by your bed so that they are the first thing you see in the morning, have a pair right outside the bathroom so you’ll put them on after showering, and/or keep some upstairs and some downstairs. Similarly, we can apply this “law” to weight training. Belinda Beck and I discussed how starting a weight training program can be highly beneficial for older women to stave off age-related bone loss, and for those who haven’t been in the habit of engaging in this type of exercise, an obvious cue would be very helpful in forming such a habit. Do you want to lift first thing in the morning? Put a small weight outside your bedroom door or near the coffee maker. If you prefer to do it in the evening, place a weight near where you keep your pajamas or next to the couch where you relax after work. Cues like this will help you begin to connect the habit with a specific time of day and allow you to incorporate it into your daily routine. 2. Make it attractive We all intuitively know that making something appealing or exciting will increase our motivation to do it. Your social environment is very important in determining how attractive something is, especially in the long term. If your goal is to stop drinking, going to bars with your martini-loving friends is going to make you miserable and undermine your goal. Having an alcohol-free game night at your house, though, can help you to break the association between drinking and fun and offers the added bonus of the anticipation of having friends over. The physical environment is important in developing habits too. If your goal is to eat more vegetables, make sure your pantry isn’t full of tempting junk food and that your fridge is stocked with your favorite vegetable-based snacks. One of the most effective ways of making a new habit attractive is to involve a friend. A woman trying to follow Belinda Beck’s suggestion to do resistance training might find it much more enjoyable to begin the program with a group of friends or by finding a weightlifting club for seniors. As another example, in my discussion with Eric Ravussin , we talked about the advantages of intermittent fasting. Breaking your fast with a friend who is also practicing IF, or texting each other in support as you adjust to fasting hours, can change the feeling of the experience from a limitation to a cooperative endeavor. This can also work with children and pets: a walk can be an opportunity to talk to your child away from screens, and going for a run might be a great time to enjoy the fresh air with your dog. 3. Make it easy Convenience and simplicity make it more likely that you will perform a behavior regularly. James gave an example of a man who went to the gym for six weeks but only stayed for five minutes; he made going to the gym much easier by focusing first on the habit of getting there , without concerning himself with the more intimidating task of working out for an hour. The “two-minute rule” can also be useful when you are getting started: condense the habit you want to start into something that takes two minutes or fewer to do. This feels much more manageable and allows you to gradually build up as each step feels easier to do. In my conversation with Luc van Loon , he stressed how multiple periods of inactivity can result in drops in muscle mass. Consistency of training is important, but it’s hard to keep up when your routine changes, such as when you’re on a business trip. These circumstances might necessitate finding a way to reintroduce convenience and simplicity. If your hotel doesn’t have a gym, bring travel weights you can fill with water so you have them available when you need them. Before you leave home, locate a park near your hotel where you could run or walk so you don’t have to make any effort to figure out where to go once you arrive. Making it as easy as possible to keep up your fitness routine increases the chances that you will avoid gaps in your exercise program. 4. Make it satisfying Tracking your progress and seeing the improvements that come with your new habit will provide a strong motivation to keep progressing towards your goal. After my interview with Olav Bu about VO 2 max, I purchased a portable VO 2 device and had a lot of fun tracking this metric during various activities. While not everyone may want to shell out the high cost of these devices, it’s a great example of measurement being a good motivator – it interested me and had the added benefit of encouraging exercise so I could monitor my levels. This can be applied to a number of health habits: watching your weight decrease, your muscle mass go up, or your blood glucose levels stabilize is deeply satisfying. Not all progress is easily measurable, though, so short-term rewards can also be an effective way of making change feel satisfying. Imagine buying yourself a new outfit after a month of successful weight training or splurging on a new sound system after redesigning your environment to support healthy eating and keeping it that way for six weeks. However, we must be careful to ensure the rewards are consistent with the overall goals: don’t buy yourself ice cream as a reward for losing weight or a more comfortable couch for becoming physically active. Breaking bad habits Just as it’s important to develop good habits, it’s often necessary to break bad ones. Unsurprisingly, the steps for breaking a bad habit are the reverse of the four laws for developing good ones. Figure 2. Four Laws of Behavior Change for Breaking Bad Habits. Credit: radreads.co On The Drive , Julia Wattacheril emphasized that maintaining liver health is a particularly high priority because we have no way of repairing the liver or replicating its function beyond a certain point. Reducing or quitting alcohol consumption is key to preventing liver damage, including alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD). This is a perfect example of how to apply the anti-rules to break a bad habit. We can “make it invisible” by removing alcohol from anywhere that’s easy to see, such as by placing it in the rear of a cupboard rather than on a countertop. We can “make it unattractive” by avoiding bars and parties where everyone around will be drinking and engaging in more alcohol-free social time to sever the association between alcohol and fun in your mind. Perhaps you can even recall a time you got sick from overdrinking or carry a photo of a diseased liver in your wallet. To “make it difficult,” one might lock alcohol in a difficult-to-reach place, or better yet, avoid keeping alcohol in the house at all. It takes much more effort to run to the store than to walk to the next room. And finally, we can “make it unsatisfying” by imposing small punishments for exceeding your desired drinking amount. Perhaps for each drink you have, you have to pay an accountability partner or forgo watching your favorite show. If there is a food that upsets your digestive system, try pairing it with drinking until you associate the bad feeling with the taste of alcohol. Bottom line Setting up good health habits now can enhance your healthspan and likely your lifespan, too. The “laws” we learned from James Clear can help us apply the lessons we learned from the other podcast guests. In our podcasts, we aim to provide you with actionable steps to put the science of longevity into practice. As we enter a new year, think about the health goals you’d like to reach and the “atomic habits” that will help you get there. Happy New Year!

At one end, those who lack health awareness may disregard advice to lose weight or avoid smoking and may miss opportunities for prevention and treatment of diseases by skipping recommended check-ups and avoiding the healthcare system altogether. It’s easy to see how this lack of awareness can result in poor health outcomes and shorter lifespan. Anyone reading this newsletter is likely on the more health-conscious side of the spectrum, paying closer attention to your body and following health recommendations as best you can in an effort to support early detection and prompt treatment of issues. However, when health awareness crosses into health anxiety , it can lead to excessive worry and hypervigilance that, as shown in a study by Mataix-Cols et al., may actually undermine health and quality of life by fostering increased stress. 1 When health-consciousness reaches extremes At the extreme end of the health-consciousness spectrum, health awareness can turn detrimental, evolving into hypochondriasis – a chronic psychiatric condition marked by a persistent and intense fear of having a serious illness. Unlike the proactive use of screenings and appropriate follow-ups, individuals with hypochondriasis frequently pursue medical tests, imaging, and procedures in an effort to alleviate their worry, often with little lasting relief. This anxiety-driven overuse of medical resources does not stem from a balanced pursuit of health but rather from a deep-seated belief that something must be wrong, regardless of test results. For those affected, any reassurance is temporary, and the cycle of fear and medical intervention continues, often placing strain on both the individual and the healthcare system. About the study The retrospective analysis by authors Mataix-Cols et al. sought to identify whether any relationship existed between diagnosed hypochondriasis and both all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality. In other words – was being diagnosed with hypochondriasis associated with higher rates of death in this population? And if so, were they more likely to die of a particular cause? To accomplish this, the authors pulled data on diagnosed cases and controls (ages 6 and above) within the Swedish population from January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2020. For each hypochondriasis case included (n=4,129), ten demographically matched controls were added to the analysis (n=41,290). In their analysis, the researchers adjusted for confounding factors like age, country of birth, highest level of education, marriage status, family income, and presence of other psychiatric disorders. Results using this adjusted model demonstrated that hypochondriasis was associated with a 69% higher risk of all-cause mortality than controls (HR=1.69; 95% CI: 1.47–1.93). When broken down into natural and unnatural causes of death, both had increased risk (natural HR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.38-1.85; unnatural HR=2.43; 95% CI: 1.61-3.68). To dig deeper into the particular diseases ailing these individuals, the authors ran the analysis for specific causes (i.e., diseases of the circulatory system, nervous system, respiratory system, cancer, etc.). For cause-specific mortality related to natural deaths, those diagnosed with hypochondriasis had a 52% increased risk of circulatory diseases (HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.21–1.92) and a 133% increased risk of respiratory diseases (HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.50–3.61). Suicide was the largest contributer to unnatural deaths (HR=4.14; 95% CI: 2.44-7.03). Collectively, these results indicate that higher health anxiety correlates with higher mortality risk, but what might explain such a link? Interpreting these data Health anxiety, like generalized anxiety or chronic stress, may be linked to various detrimental physiological changes. For example, higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol can suppress immune function and lead to metabolic issues such as insulin resistance. In the cardiovascular system, anxiety can increase heart rate and blood pressure via sympathetic nervous system activation (the “fight or flight” response), elevating risks for hypertension and heart disease. These are just a couple of possible ways that prolonged anxiety can impact physical health. Despite the plausibility of the mechanisms, this study has inherent limitations – like all observational research, it can identify associations but cannot prove causation. The findings show a link between hypochondriasis and increased mortality risk, but it remains unclear whether health anxiety directly influences mortality rates or if other underlying factors contribute to this association. Another consideration is the potential for reverse causality, as those who are at higher risk for certain diseases might therefore become more anxious about their health. Individuals with a family history of early mortality may be more prone to health anxiety due to heightened awareness or fear of genetic predispositions, which could amplify their health-seeking behaviors. The study may also suffer from biases in its participant pool. The cohort was limited to a Swedish population, which may not reflect the prevalence or characteristics of hypochondriasis in more diverse global settings. Furthermore, hypochondriasis is likely underdiagnosed, meaning only the most severely affected individuals were included in the hypochondriasis group. This leaves many mild or moderate cases of health anxiety undetected in the general population, and they may even be in the control group. As a result, we don’t know the mortality risks for individuals with less severe health anxiety, which might not impact their health as intensely. Grounded health practices that deliver Let’s take a deep breath and ground ourselves in reality. It’s obviously important to pay attention to your health, but it’s also easy to feel overwhelmed by health concerns or to get caught up in the latest wellness trends. Where do we find a balance? The truth is that there are simple, effective practices that yield great returns for your health and well-being. These practices don’t require extreme measures or a biohacker’s mindset – they’re approachable, sustainable, and often free or low-cost. (See my thoughts on “biohacking” in a newsletter from earlier this year.) Importantly, key habits like regular cardiovascular, strength, and mobility exercise offer immense benefits. Being mindful of eating habits and not being overnourished is another sustainable habit with great returns on investment. Regular health screenings and recommended tests are foundational, as they allow us to catch potential issues early and address them proactively. Being curious, observant, and proactive with your health can lead to substantial positive outcomes without needing to obsess over every small detail. This approach encourages a sense of balance, allowing you to engage in health-promoting behaviors without tipping into excessive worry. But it’s also important to recognize that managing health anxiety or hypochondriasis is not a matter of fault; these conditions are often deeply ingrained and require thoughtful, compassionate approaches. For those with health anxiety, working with a mental health professional can make a significant difference, helping to reshape thought patterns and reduce the need for constant health-checking behaviors. Recognizing when health vigilance becomes problematic can be challenging, as each person has a unique tolerance for how much focus on health feels right. A potential red flag is when health concerns lead to physical symptoms like fatigue or compulsive behaviors or when they disrupt daily activities. Mental health is not only tied to our healthspan but also our lifespan, making it essential to seek support if health anxiety or other mental health issues are interfering with life. Approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for health anxiety are highly effective, offering tools to manage and reduce anxiety over time. Find your sweet spot A balanced approach to health is key. While vigilance can certainly play a role in preventing and detecting health issues early, an overly anxious focus on health can actually be counterproductive. Despite limitations in the study by Matraix-Cols et al., the idea that chronic stress and anxiety affects your physical health is well-established, and the notion that this link extends also to health -related anxiety is entirely probable. Engaging in foundational health practices like regular exercise, mindful eating, and routine screenings offers the best returns for overall well-being without tipping into hypervigilance. For those who find health anxiety to be a persistent struggle, seeking professional support, such as CBT, can be invaluable. Ultimately, taking care of both physical and mental health enables us to live healthy, balanced lives, in which health is a priority but not an all-consuming concern.

The hippocampus (the brain region largely responsible for the consolidation of these memories) has been shown to decrease in volume with age. 1 Perhaps preventing or reversing hippocampal atrophy (shrinkage) and the associated decline in learning and memory could prevent the onset of dementia. Back in “Ask Me Anything” episode #46 of The Drive , I discussed how physical activity can reduce risk of cognitive decline by various mechanisms, but research on the most effective forms of exercise for this purpose has been limited. Yet a randomized study by Blackmore & Schaumberg et al. recently addressed certain aspects of this very question, comparing the effects of various training intensities on learning and memory. 2 About the study The authors performed a randomized controlled study involving a six-month exercise regimen with cognitively normal participants (65-85 years old) split into one of three groups: light-intensity training (LIT, n=53), medium-intensity training (MIT, n=44), or high-intensity interval training (HIIT, n=54). In this case, LIT served essentially as a non-exercise control group, as training was limited to stretching, balance work, and relaxation. Participants across all groups exercised three times per week under supervision, with each session totalling 40-45 minutes including warmup and cooldown. Specific exercise protocols are detailed below. Table: Exercise protocols The authors were primarily interested in changes in cognitive function following these exercise regimens. This was measured using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) – a series of tasks performed on a computer that includes an array of memory tests. HIIT performs better than MIT or LIT in improving PAL scores While the investigators conducted four tests within the CANTAB battery, results from only one – the Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test – were found to differ significantly between groups. For this test, which assesses how well people learn and recall associations (i.e., visual learning and associative memory – which are among the earliest cognitive domains affected by Alzheimer’s disease), participants are shown patterns hidden behind rectangles and must click the correct one when a matching pattern appears, and performance is measured by the number of errors.. Results from the PAL tests were reported as standardized changes from baseline and tracked over time for comparison across groups. At 6 months, HIIT outperformed LIT (effect size=0.72, P =0.004) and MIT (effect size=0.74, P =0.008). (For reference, an effect size of 0.2-0.5 is considered small; 0.5-0.8 is considered moderate; and >0.8 is considered a large effect.) The PAL score improvement in the HIIT group persisted for all of the follow-up time points after the conclusion of the intervention period, with one measurement taken at 12 months after baseline, followed by time points out to five years, presented as the average of 48-60 months. When the authors limited their analysis to only the worst performers at baseline (those with scores greater than one standard deviation above the mean in PAL scores), the HIIT group once again performed better than the LIT group and MIT group, but the effects were substantially larger (effect sizes of 1.4 and 1.7 for HIIT versus LIT and MIT, respectively). Again, this was maintained throughout the follow-up period. These results demonstrate that people with the worst cognitive performance at baseline benefited most from HIIT exercise. Is HIIT the best, case closed? This all sounds very promising, but don’t mistake these findings as a reason to drop other exercise modalities in exchange for cramming in as many HIIT sessions as possible. One major issue with the comparisons made in this study is rooted in the experimental design. While it may seem intuitive to normalize each group based on time spent in the gym, the results would actually be more comparable if the authors had normalized based on energy expenditure (i.e., metabolic equivalents, or METs). I am not surprised that the HIIT group performed better in some tests, as they did more work in the same amount of time. Let’s take a back-of-the-envelope calculation – say an MIT session has an energy expenditure of 5 METs while a HIIT session has an expenditure of 8 METs. (Of course, this is an estimate and would need to be measured in the study.) At 30 minutes per session, three days per week, and 24 weeks in the study, this would result in 180 MET-hours total for the MIT group and 288 MET-hours for the HIIT group. This experiment provides great insight for those who have limited time in the gym (e.g., three times per week, as done in the study). But for a more realistic comparison of the effect of exercise intensity, protocols should be normalized to the total amount of energy expenditure, rather than time. Another critical limitation of this study is its scope. PAL is just one of many cognitive tests – one of eight tests in the memory section alone of just one neuropsychological battery, making the scope of this study quite narrow. 3 The authors report findings for four of the eight tests (working memory, delayed match to sample, and emotional recognition task, in addition to PAL), but no significant differences were found between groups in any of the other cognitive tests performed in this study. Indeed, even for the PAL test, the “practice effect” (learning through repetition) could influence results, as the test-retest reliability of PAL has been called into question in previous analyses. 4 All of that to say – sure, HIIT is superior when you severely limit the scope to a small portion of cognitive function; and for those at high risk of dementia, HIIT could be quite beneficial in improving function. But, does this information allow us to make practically useful decisions when you consider a broader scope of longevity? Decidedly not. The benefits of a balanced exercise routine Familiar readers will know my framework for exercise is built on four pillars: stability, strength, aerobic base (Zone 2), and peak aerobic capacity (Zone 5). Most relevant to the discussion at hand are the latter two. High intensity training (Zone 5) has an important place in an overall exercise regimen; however, despite the results of the current study, it should not constitute the entirety of one’s exercise regimen, nor should it even consume a larger portion of time than moderate intensity training (Zone 2). This, of course, is because the benefits of exercise extend far beyond the one single cognitive domain reported by Blackmore & Schaumberg et al. I have detailed the many, varied benefits of each of the four pillars in past content, such as in my recent premium articles on Zone 2 training and Zone 5 (important to increase VO 2 max) training, as well as various discussions on stability and strength . But just to highlight a few here, improving Zone 2 threshold increases fat oxidation capacity and mitochondrial function, which in turn has benefits for combating aging and reducing risk of numerous diseases, including cardiovascular disease, 5 neurodegenerative disease, 6 and metabolic syndrome. 7,8 Stability and strength are both vital for preventing falls, a major cause of mortality in older adults, while strength training additionally improves metabolic health, bone density, and overall quality of life. So what? Is memory loss an inevitable part of aging? Are we doomed to a future of constantly searching for our glasses (which, let’s be honest, are usually on our head)? While the findings from Blackmore & Schaumberg et al. offer hope that regular exercise, particularly HIIT, might delay or even reverse cognitive decline, it doesn’t mean everyone should be doing HIIT exclusively. The results of the present study may add “associative memory and visual learning” to the list of the benefits of exercise in general for health and longevity; however, it is not clear whether this can be attributed specifically to the high intensity level of the exercise, or simply due to increased energy expenditure in the HIIT group. Without normalizing the exercise protocol to METs, we cannot know if these effects are associated with HIIT per se . Meanwhile, the list of benefits for other forms of exercise (e.g., Zone 2, strength training) had already been long, populated with effects that have at least as great an impact on lifespan and healthspan as those reported in this study. There’s still much to learn about the benefits of various exercise types and which precise balance of intensities and modalities might be optimal for different individuals, but none can be ignored completely. It’s clear that consistent exercise is crucial to aging well, and a well-balanced routine has components of moderate-intensity and high-intensity exercise, as well as strength and stability training.
