      "Strength & Muscle MassMy framework for exercise is built upon four pillars: stability, strength, aerobic efficiency, and anaerobic performance. Strength may be the most intimidating of the four, especially for people who aren’t accustomed to strength training. In its simplest form, strength means utilizing muscle to generate force. And if you are interested in living a long and healthy life and playing with your great-grandkids someday, then muscle mass should be a priority. Never in the history of human civilization has a 90-year-old said, “I wish I had less muscle.” Below are a compilation of clips, podcasts, and articles specifically discussing the longevity benefits from greater muscle mass and strength, as well as tactics for preserving muscle mass.\n",
      "StabilityIf you’ve been following me for a while, you may know that my framework for exercise is built upon four pillars: stability, strength, aerobic efficiency, and anaerobic performance. Stability is truly the cornerstone upon which your strength, your aerobic performance, and your anaerobic performance relies. And when it comes to working on any of the other pillars, stability is critical for doing so safely. Below is a compilation of clips, articles, and podcasts specifically discussing stability. My hope is that this content can serve as helpful resources to dive deeper into this topic and support how stability can help you along your ongoing longevity journey.\n",
      "Zone 2Zone 2 is the third of four pillars in my framework for exercise: aerobic exercise. Zone 2 is defined as the highest metabolic output/work that you can sustain while keeping your lactate level below two millimole per liter. Below is a compilation of clips, podcasts, and articles all about zone 2 training, why it is important, and how often you should be incorporating it into your exercise regimen.\n",
      "VO2 MaxYou have likely heard me talk about the importance of knowing and tracking your VO2 max. As Alex Hutchinson and I discussed in episode #151, your VO2 max refers to the maximum rate at which your muscles can extract oxygen from your blood and put it to metabolic use to generate energy. Your VO2 max is often used as an indicator of overall cardiorespiratory fitness and can serve as a metric for tracking progress. As I discussed in detail during AMA #27 and again on Twitter in early March 2022, when looking at VO2 max in relation to all-cause mortality, we see a very clear trend. Simply bringing your VO2 max from ‘low’ (bottom 25th percentile) to ‘below average’ (25th to 50th percentile) is associated with a 50% reduction in all-cause mortality. When you go from ‘low’ to ‘above average’ (50th to 75th percentile) the risk reduction is closer to 70%! The following is a collection of content diving deeper into the topic of VO2 max, including: what it is, how it is measured, and how to improve your VO2 max with Zone 5 training.\n",
      "Centenarian Decathlon\n",
      "High Intensity & Zone 5 TrainingZone 5 exercise, a high-intensity zone, is the fourth pillar of my framework for exercise: anaerobic performance. While you do not need to spend nearly as much time in Zone 5 as you do Zone 2, neglecting it completely may come at a cost down the road. Below is a compilation of clips, podcasts, and articles specifically discussing Zone 5 exercise, VO2 max, and higher intensity exercise. \n",

      "Body Composition & DEXAMany of us use body weight or BMI (body mass index) for a quick approximation of our health status. Yet the utility of these metrics is limited because they provide little information about a far more relevant parameter: body composition – and in particular, body fat and its distribution. Body weight and BMI alone do not discriminate between muscle mass (which we want to maintain or increase to promote longevity) and fat mass (which we generally want to keep relatively low). Thus, when we set a goal to “lose weight,” our real aim ought to be losing fat. Losing fat mass isn’t necessarily easy, but unfortunately, that struggle pales in comparison to the challenge of keeping it off. This is caused in large part by a hormone called leptin, which is secreted by fat cells and plays a critical role in numerous endocrine pathways and functions, including the regulation of energy homeostasis. Leptin is secreted at levels proportional to body fat and acts as a “satiety hormone” in the brain, causing a reduction in food intake. However, as leptin signaling decreases – due to fat loss or to key neurons becoming leptin-resistant – the brain interprets this as a sign…\n",
      "ProteinMost people do not consume enough protein. As I discussed in episode #202, protein consumption is a variable I’ve become increasingly attuned to with my patients. The more I research this topic, the more I find that the RDA (recommended daily allowance) of 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight is simply not sufficient to build and maintain muscle mass as we age — a critical component of my 4-part exercise framework for longevity. Instead, in our practice, we recommend patients aim to consume 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (or about 1 gram per pound).  I have found that this level of protein consumption can often be difficult for patients if they are also fasting or engaging in time-restricted feeding (TRF). Although fasting and TRF can be useful tools in some cases, particularly in combating insulin resistance, for others they can be problematic due to the heightened risk of protein deficiency and subsequent loss of muscle mass.  Below is a collection of content that dives deeper into this topic, including dispelling the myth that excess protein intake increases cancer risk.\n",

      "All sleepGood sleep is critical to our innate physiological repair processes, while poor sleep triggers a cascade of negative downstream consequences, from insulin resistance to cognitive decline, as well as mental health issues. Study after study has found powerful associations between insufficient sleep and adverse health outcomes ranging from the common cold to cardiovascular disease. But as important as sleep is for the physical body, it may even be more so for the brain. Good sleep—in terms of both amount and quality—is critical to our cognitive function, our memory, and even our emotional equilibrium. Below is a collection of past articles, audio clips, and podcasts discussing the science of sleep and how sleep can be a powerful longevity tool. If you are new to this content, I would strongly recommend listening to our 7-part series with sleep expert Matthew Walker, where we discuss everything you could possibly want to know about sleep, the affects of sleep on your health, and how to improve it.\n",
