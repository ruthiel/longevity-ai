## Overview
"Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity" presents Dr. Peter Attia's comprehensive framework for extending both lifespan and healthspan. The book introduces "Medicine 3.0," a proactive, personalized approach to health that focuses on preventing chronic diseases and optimizing performance throughout life.

## Core Thesis: Medicine 3.0

### Evolution of Medical Practice
- **Medicine 1.0**: Ancient practices, limited scientific basis
- **Medicine 2.0**: Modern medicine focused on treating disease after it occurs
- **Medicine 3.0**: Proactive prevention and optimization before disease manifests

### The Four Horsemen of Death
The primary chronic diseases that Medicine 3.0 aims to prevent:
1. **Cardiovascular Disease**: Leading cause of death globally
2. **Cancer**: Complex group of diseases requiring early intervention
3. **Neurodegenerative Disease**: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and related conditions
4. **Metabolic Dysfunction**: Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome

### Lifespan vs. Healthspan
- **Lifespan**: Total years lived
- **Healthspan**: Years lived in good health and function
- **Marginal decade**: The final 10-20 years often marked by decline
- Goal: Extend healthspan to match or exceed lifespan extension
